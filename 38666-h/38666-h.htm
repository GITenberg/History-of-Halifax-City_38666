<p id="begin">HISTORY OF HALIFAX CITY.</p>

<h2 id="chap-one"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>Halifax, the metropolis of Nova Scotia, and the chief City of the
Acadian or Lower Provinces, was founded in the year 1749, at the
expense of Government, under the direction of the Lords of Trade
and Plantations, and was named in compliment to George Montague,
Earl of Halifax, then at the head of the Board, under whose immediate
auspices the settlement was undertaken.</p>

<p>From the Treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, when Acadia was ceded to
the Crown of Great Britain, to the year 1749, no progress had been
made by the British in colonizing the country. The inhabitants
consisted of a few thousand Acadian peasants, scattered around
the shores of the Basin of Minas, Chignecto and the Valley of
Annapolis. The Governor resided at Annapolis Royal, a small fortified
port, with a garrison of two or three hundred regular troops, and
was, in a great measure, dependent on New England for his necessary
supplies. This was the only British port within the Province,
with the exception of that of Canso, where, during the fishing season,
a number of French, with a few Indians and New England fishermen,
assembled, and where a captain's guard was usually stationed
to preserve order and protect the rights of property. The French
population, though professing to be neutral, had refused to take the
Oath of Allegiance to the Crown of Great Britain, and were continually
in a state of hostility to the British authorities in the country.
Their poverty and ignorance placed them completely under the
control of a few designing emissaries of the French Governor at
Quebec, who incited the people to resent British rule, and frequently
put all law at defiance, by assuming to themselves the sole management
of municipal affairs in the settlements most remote from the
seat of Government. The Governors of Canada had undertaken to
claim all the country from the River St. Lawrence to the Bay of
Fundy, as comprehended within their jurisdiction, confining the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
territory of Acadia as ceded under the Treaty of Utrecht, to the
Peninsula alone, and had actually commenced to erect forts on the
River St. John and the Isthmus while the nations were at peace.</p>

<p>The necessity of a permanent British settlement and Military
Station on the Atlantic Coast of the Peninsula, had long been considered
the only effectual means of preserving British authority, as
well as for the protection of the coast fishing, which, at this time,
was deemed of paramount importance to British interests. But
lately the continual breaches of neutrality on the part of the French,
together with the loss of Louisburg, under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle,
in October, 1748, rendered such an establishment indispensably
necessary to the support of the British Crown in Nova
Scotia.</p>

<p>The scheme for settlement at Chebucto is said to have originated
with the people of Massachusetts,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who, in calling the attention of
Government to the claims and encroachments of the French, suggested
the necessity for, as well as the great commercial advantages to
be derived from such an undertaking; and it has also been asserted
that a committee of influential citizens had been formed in Boston
for the purpose of more effectually advocating the design. No
authentic information on the subject, however, has been found
beyond the suggestions contained in Governor Shirley's letters to
the Secretary of State, in 1747 and 8, in which one extensive plan
of British colonization throughout Nova Scotia is proposed and
details suggested, many of which, however, did not receive the
approval of Government.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A plan for carrying into effect this long-cherished design was,
however, matured by the Board of Trade and Plantations, in the
year 1748, and submitted to Government in the autumn of that
year, and being warmly supported by Lord Halifax, the President of
the Board, advertisements soon appeared under the sanction of His
Majesty's authority, "holding out proper encouragement to officers
and private men lately discharged from the Army and Navy, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
settle in Nova Scotia." Among other inducements was the offer to
convey the settlers to their destination, maintain them for twelve
months at the public expense, and to supply them with arms and
ammunition for defence, and with materials and articles for clearing
the land, erecting dwellings and prosecuting the fishery. The encouragements
appeared so inviting, that in a short time 1176 settlers,
with their families, were found to volunteer, and the sum of £40,000
being appropriated by Parliament for the service, the expedition
was placed under the command of Col. the Honble. Edward Cornwallis,
M. P., as Captain General and Governor of Nova Scotia,
and set sail for Chebucto Bay, the place of destination, in May,
1749.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The fleet consisted of 13 Transports and a Sloop of War. The
following is a list of the vessels, with the number of settlers.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

On the 21st June, 1749, old style, the Sloop of War, "Sphinx,"
arrived in the Harbor of Chebucto, having on board, the Honourable
Edward Cornwallis, Captain General and Governor-in-Chief of
the Province of Nova Scotia, and his suite. They had a long and
boisterous passage, and did not make the coast of Acadia until 14th.
They had no one on board acquainted with the coast, and did not
meet with a pilot until the 20th, when they fell in with a Sloop
from Boston, bound to Louisburg, with two pilots for the Government
of that place. Governor Cornwallis' intention was first to proceed
to Annapolis, but the wind not serving for the Bay of Fundy,
and the officers assuring him that in case of foggy weather setting in
they might be a long time in getting to Annapolis, he concluded on
proceeding at once to Chebucto, rather than risk the possibility of
being separated for any length of time from the fleet. He also felt,
that by so doing, he would save the Governor of Louisburg the bad
and long navigation to Annapolis, and accordingly, he dispatched a
letter to Governor Hopson, by the Sloop, apprising him of his intention
and desiring him to transport his garrison to Chebucto as soon
as possible. The "Sphinx," before making Chebucto, first came to
anchor in Malagash Bay, where they found several French families,
comfortably settled, who professed themselves British subjects, and
had grants of land from Governor Mascarine; they had tolerably
good wooden houses covered with bark, and many cattle, and expressed
themselves greatly pleased on hearing of the proposed new
settlement. It happened that the same day on which Cornwallis
arrived in the Harbor of Chebucto, a sloop came in from Louisburg
with a letter from Hopson in expectation of meeting him. Hopson
was in great perplexity, the French having arrived to take possession
under the terms of the treaty, and there were no vessels to embark
his troops. It appeared he was fully under the expectation that the
ships which were to bring out the settlers would arrive in time to be
sent down to him for that purpose, and he had made no other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
arrangements. On receiving the letter, Governor Cornwallis immediately
dispatched the Sloop to Boston, with letters to Apthorp
&amp; Handerik, whom Hopson recommended for the purpose, to hire
vessels with all expedition to transport the garrison of Louisburg
to Chebucto; also a letter directed to Governor Mascarine in case
they should meet at sea with a vessel bound to Annapolis. At the
same time, a Frenchman, acquainted with the country, was dispatched
overland by Minas to Annapolis, with orders to Mascarine to come
down with a quorum of his Council as soon as possible, that the
new commission might be opened and another Council appointed in
accordance with the Royal Instructions.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Governor Cornwallis' first dispatch to England, after arriving
at Chebucto, was sent via Boston, and bears the date 22nd June, the
day after his arrival. In this letter he says: "The coasts are as
rich as ever they have been represented; we caught fish every day
since we came, within 50 leagues of the coast. The harbour itself
is full of fish of all kinds. All the officers agree the harbour is the
finest they have ever seen. The country is one continued wood; no
clear spot is to be seen or heard of. I have been on shore in several
places. The underwood is only young trees, so that with difficulty
one is able to make his way anywhere." "D'Anville's Fleet have
only cut wood for present use; they cleared no ground, but encamped
their men on the beach. I have seen but few brooks, nor as
yet have found the navigable river that has been talked of. There
are a few French families on the east side of the bay, about three
leagues off. Some have been on board."</p>

<p>Governor Mascarine having received Cornwallis' letter on the 26th,
on the following day, ordered Captain Davis to make ready his
galley and go round to Chebucto with fresh provisions. Mascarine
was waiting the arrival of the new Governor at Annapolis, as
appears by his letters to Governor Hopson on the 14th and 26th
June, in which he says: "Get ready supplies for the new Captain
General who will be here, but the fleet will be at Chebucto." The
"Snow Fair Lady" arrived shortly after the Sphinx, and was
dispatched to Annapolis to afford Mr. Mascarine the means of
transporting his council and part of his garrison to Chebucto. On
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
the 26th, the "Fair Lady" was in the harbour of Annapolis ready to
receive Governor Mascarine and suite. On the 27th, the transport
began to make their appearance off the harbour of Chebucto, and
by the 1st July, they had all arrived. As their passage had been
extremely good, and none of them had in the least suffered, the
Governor found himself in a position to afford vessels to Colonel
Hopson the moment the settlers should be put on shore.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Accordingly
having countermanded the order to Boston for transports, he
dispatched to Louisburg the ship "Brotherhood" on the 1st July,
and on the 5th, the "London," "Wilmington," "Winchelsea," and
"Merry Jacks." On the 8th he received from Louisburg, copies
of letters from Governor Shirley of Boston, to Governor Mascarine,
giving an account of the French having commenced a fort at the
mouth of the River St. John, and on the following day sent Captain
Rouse in the "Albany" and a small sloop to attend her, with
orders to the commanding officer at Annapolis to furnish him with
troops if required, and to proceed immediately to the River St.
John, Governor Shirley having previously sent the ship "Boston"
to Annapolis for the same service, there to await orders. It appears
that the French had fitted out an expedition, under M. Ramey, for
this purpose, a short time before the arrival of Cornwallis, and the
vessel with ammunition, arms and provisions, bound to St. John
River, had passed Malagash Bay a few days before the arrival of the
"Sphinx" there; but having put into Port Mouton on her way, the
information of their designs was communicated to the authorities of
Annapolis.</p>

<p>Governor Mascarine having arrived with several of his Council on
the 12th, the following day Governor Cornwallis opened his commission
and took the oaths of office in their presence, and on Friday,
the 14th July, the Civil Government was organized, and Colonel
Paul Mascarine, Captain Edward How, Captain John Gorham,
Benjamin Green, John Salsbury and Hugh Davidson were sworn in
Councillors<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> on board the "Beaufort" Transport, and the Commission
and Royal Instructions were then read. "The formation of the
Board was announced to the people by a general salute from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
ships in the harbour and the day was devoted to festivity and amusement."
The four first gentlemen named in the Council were officers
from Annapolis; Mr. Green was from Massachusetts, and had been
with General Hopson at Louisburg, and the two latter were of His
Excellency's suite; Mr. Davidson acted as Secretary.</p>

<p>Early in the month of July, a spot for the settlement was pitched
upon near Point Pleasant,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> then called Sandwich Point, and people
were employed in cutting down the trees; but the want of sufficient
depth of water in front, its great exposure to south-east gales and
other inconveniences being discovered, it was abandoned for a more
eligible situation to the northward, commanding a prospect of the
whole harbour and on an easy ascent with bold anchorage close
to the shore. Here Mr. Bruce the engineer, and Captain Morris the
surveyor, were ordered to lay out the town, which was surveyed, the
plan completed and the lots appropriated to their respective owners
by the 14th September. The town was laid out in squares or blocks
of 320 by 120 feet deep, the streets being 55 feet<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in width. Each
block contained 16 town lots, forty feet front by sixty deep, and the
whole was afterwards divided into five divisions or wards, called
Callendar's, Galland's, Ewer's, Collier's and Foreman's divisions,
after the names of the persons who were appointed Captains of
Militia, each ward being large enough to supply one company.</p>

<p>Buckingham Street was the north and Salter Street the south limit,
and the whole was surrounded by a strong palisade of pickets with
block houses or log forts at convenient distances. Foreman's new
division was afterwards added as far as the present Jacob Street.
The north and south suburbs were surveyed about the same time, but
the German lots in the north were not laid off till the year following.</p>

<p>Great difficulty was at first experienced in the erection of dwellings;
the European settlers being totally unacquainted with the
method of constructing wooden buildings. Frames and other materials
for building were, however, soon brought from Massachusetts,
and before the cold weather set in a number of comfortable dwellings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
were erected. Provisions and other necessary supplies were
regularly served out in the camp, and every exertion on the part of
the Governor made to render the settlers comfortable before the
approach of winter. Several transports were detained and housed
over to accommodate those settlers whose houses were not complete,
and the canvas tent and log hut were soon abandoned for more
convenient and comfortable accommodations.</p>

<p>I have, says Governor Cornwallis, in his letter of the 20th August,
contracted for frames and materials for barracks and officers' lodgings
from Boston. Boards are very high owing to the drought. I
have got none under £4 per thousand, and shall be obliged to
furnish a vast number to help the people to get under cover, and
have sent an officer on purpose to Boston to obtain them at a fair
price. Many houses are begun and huts and log houses already up
for more than half a mile on each side the town.</p>

<p>Tradition says that on clearing the ground for settlement a
number of dead bodies were discovered among the trees, partly
covered by the underwood, supposed to have been soldiers of the
Duke D'Anville's expedition which put into Chebucto Harbor in
1746,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> but the Governor in his letter does not mention the facts.</p>

<p>During the winter months the people were kept actively employed
in cutting pickets for fences and wood for fuel, and for erecting new
buildings. Mechanics were placed at the head of working parties to
direct their labours, and by a judicious division of the people into
small parties the more laborious portion of the work was executed
with uncommon dispatch. Mills were also erected at the expense of
Government for sawing lumber, and a mill master appointed with a
salary, and every facility held out to enable those settlers, who had
not yet been accommodated, to complete their dwellings on the
approach of spring. The Governor in his letter of 27th July,
describes the site of the Town as very advantageous. He says: "It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
has all the conveniences I could wish except a fresh water river.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Nothing is easier than to build wharves; one is already finished
for ships of 200 tons. I have constantly employed all the carpenters
I could get from Annapolis and the ships here to build log
houses for stores. I have likewise offered the French at Minas
considerable wages to work, and they have promised to send fifty
men to remain until October. As there was not one yard of clear
ground you will imagine our difficulty and what we have here to do;
however, they have already cleared about 12 acres, and I hope to
begin my house in two days; I have a small frame and pickets
ready."</p>

<p>The following extracts from a letter dated 25th July, 1749,
written by a settler,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> affords several interesting facts relative to the
state of the settlement at this time:&mdash;"On our arrival we found the
Sphinx, of 20 guns, which had come into harbor a few days before
us; as I write the transports are entering the harbor with the two
regiments of Hopson and Warberton on board from Louisburg.
The assistance, as well as the security we shall receive from them,
will greatly forward our settlement; the officers have brought all
their furniture, a great number of milch cows, and other stock,
besides military stores. We have already cleared about 20 acres,
and every one has a hut by his tent. Our work goes briskly,
and the method of employing the people in ships' companies has a
good effect, and as the Governor is preparing to lay out the lots of
land, we shall soon have a very convenient and pleasant town built,
which is to be called Halifax. There are already several wharves
built, and one gentleman is erecting a saw mill; public store houses
are also building, and grain of various sorts have been sown. We
have received constant supplies of plank and timber for building,
and fresh stock and rum in great quantities, 20 schooners frequently
coming in in one day. We have also a hundred cows and some
sheep, brought down to us by land, by the French at Minas, which
is about 30 miles distant from the bottom of the bay, and to which
we purpose to cut a road. The French Deputies who came to make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
submission have promised to send us 50 men for this purpose, and
to assist us as far as they are able; we have received the like
promise, and friendship and assistance from the Indians, the chief
having been with the Governor for that purpose. In short, every
thing is in a very prosperous way. But I should be equally unjust
and ungrateful, were I to conclude without paying the tribute which
is due to our Governor. He seems to have nothing in view but the
interest and happiness of all; his zeal and prudent conduct in the
difficult task assigned him cannot be too much admired."</p>

<p>The plan of the town having been completed and the building lots
marked out, in order to prevent dispute and discontent among the
settlers, it was deemed best that they should draw for the lots.
Accordingly, at a Council held on the 1st of August, it was resolved
that on Tuesday following, the 8th of August, all heads of families who
were settlers, should assemble at seven o'clock with the overseers,
and single men should form themselves into families, four to each
family, and each family choose one to draw for them. Mr. Bruce
the engineer, being present on the occasion, assisted in distributing
the lots according to the arrangement, and the whole were entered in
a book of registry which was to be kept for the purpose and to constitute
evidence of title and possession.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The next object of importance was the erection of proper defences
for the protection of the settlement. After they had taken possession
of the lots, and commenced to build, the Governor endeavoured
to induce the people to work for a few days in throwing up a line of
defence around their new abode; "but," says he, "there was no
persuading them to do it." It was not until the 13th August when
the Council voted 1s. 6d. per day to each man employed, that this
necessary work was commenced by the settlers. The harbour being
broad and easy of access, the difficulty of selecting proper positions
for fortifications, which would command the entrance, was at first
seriously felt. This had been the great objection on the part of the
French to making any settlement at Chebucto, La Have having
been chosen by them for the principal post on the Atlantic Coast,
being, from its narrow entrance, more easy of defence. In Admiral
Darell's plan of Chebucto, the two points that flanked the entrance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
to Bedford Basin were marked as the places proper to fortify. Mr.
Cornwallis says, their view must have been to have the settlement
within that Bay (the Basin); this would have been subject to great
inconvenience. In the first place, it would have been too far up for
the fishermen, it being about five leagues from the entrance of the
Harbour to those points, and the beach all along as well adapted
for curing their fish as can possibly be imagined; no fisherman
would ever have thought of going within these forts. Indeed no
ship would choose to go so far, as no finer harbour can be than that
of Chebucto, which reaches from these points to Sandwich River; so
that notwithstanding any forts upon these points, an enemy's fleet
might be secure and indeed block up all ships within the bay. He
accordingly fixed upon Sandwich Point and the high lands opposite,
(now called York Redoubt), and George's Island as the most proper
positions for the erection of the necessary defences. On the latter
he immediately placed a guard, landed his stores and planned and
proposed to build thereon his magazine for powder.</p>

<p>The first act of Government, after the organization of the Council
on the 14th, was an audience of the three French Deputies, who had
come down to meet the New Governor. They were Jean Melanson,
from Canard River; Claude le Blance, from Grand Pre, and Philip
Melanson from Pisiquid. Colonel Mascarine read to the Council
the oath which the French inhabitants had before taken. Being
asked if they had anything to offer from their several departments,
they answered that they were sent only to pay their respects to His
Excellency and to know what was to be their condition henceforth,
and whether they would be allowed their priests. They were assured
that their religion should be protected, but that, as heretofore, no
priest should be permitted to officiate within the Province, without
having first obtained a license from the Governor. They were
furnished with copies of the Royal Declaration, a proclamation
issued by Governor Cornwallis, and the oath which had been customary,
with directions to return within a fortnight, to report to the
Council the views of the inhabitants of the respective districts, and
also to notify the other settlements to send deputies as soon as
possible. The second meeting of the Council took place on the 17th,
when Mr. Wm. Steele was sworn in a member of the Board, and on
the following day the Governor's proclamation was read in the camp,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
prohibiting all persons from leaving the Province without permission,
and against the retail of spirituous liquors without license.</p>

<p>On the 18th, Mr. Bruce the Engineer, Lieutenants Ewer, Collier
and Mr. John Duport were appointed Justices of the peace, and all
the settlers having assembled in separate companies with their
respective overseers, each company chose its constables.</p>

<p>The Governor designed opening more perfect means of communication
with Minas by constructing a road, which he described as
being 30 miles only, in a direct line, and to build a Block House
half way, but having only two companies of soldiers with him, one
of Hopson's and one of Warberton's regiment, together with about
60 of Goreham's Indian Rangers, and the 50 French, who promised
to assist in the work, having disappointed him, he was compelled to
postpone the object until after the arrival of the army from Louisburg.
Proper access to the interior, by the construction of a good
road to Minas, was deemed of paramount importance to the settlement
of the country. The inhabitants of the rural districts were so
insulated as to be in a great measure independent of all authority.
Colonel Mascarine, on returning to Annapolis, received directions to
send a Captain, 3 Subalterns and 100 men to Minas, and to erect a
Block-house and Battery there, the troops to be first quartered at
Grand Pre, where the Block-house was to be built, and the French
people were to be hired at fair wages to assist in the work.</p>

<p>Capt. How, who had been sent to St. John River in the Albany
with Capt. Rouse, having returned overland with thirteen Indians,
three deputies from the tribes at St. John, the Chief of the Chinecto
Indians, and nine others of their tribes. They received an audience
on the 14th; they consisted of Francis de Salle, Chief from
Octfragli; the Chief Noellobig, from Medochig; the Chief Neptune
Albodonallilla from the Chignecto tribe, for himself and tribe. The
negotiation was carried on through Martin, the Indian, and André,
the interpreter from Minas. They stated to the Council that they
had come to confirm the treaty of 1726, and that several of them
had been present at that treaty. Terms were drawn up by Mr.
Secretary Davidson, and signed by the Chiefs on the 15th August,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
1749, and Capt. How was ordered to carry it to St. John to be ratified,
and to take with him presents to the Chiefs. It was accordingly
ratified on the 4th day of September following, and signed by
all the Chiefs and Captains at the River St. John, six in number, in
the presence of Mr. How and seven other witnesses; Madame De
Bellisle acting as interpreter by request of the Indians. This document
is still in existence; also a copy of that of 1726, sent to
Governor Cornwallis by the Governor of Massachusetts Bay. This
treaty appears to have been little regarded, for in the beginning of
October following, news arrived from Annapolis and Canso of
further incursions on the part of the Indians, and Government was
compelled to raise two new independent companies of Volunteers for
that service, which were placed under the command of Major Gilman
and Capt. Clapham, on the same footing with the Rangers under
Gorham.</p>

<p>After the evacuation of Louisburg the population received a
considerable accession; a number of the English inhabitants came
with Governor Hobson and became settlers, and many from New
England were daily arriving, and upwards of 1000 more from the
old provinces had expressed themselves desirous of joining the
Settlement before winter. The Governor therefore gave orders to
all vessels in the Government service to give them a free passage.
The New England people soon formed the basis of the resident
population, and are the ancestors of many of the present inhabitants.
They were better settlers than the old discharged soldiers
and sailors who came on the fleet; most of whom died or left the
country during the first three or four years, leaving, however, the
most industrious and respectable among them as permanent settlers.
Many settlers and traders came out for the purpose of making
money; these people infested the Settlement in great numbers, and
gave Mr. Cornwallis and his successors much trouble and annoyance,
in demoralizing the people by the illicit sale of bad liquors, and
in other ways retarding the progress of the country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
A proposition was made about this time by a French merchant
from the West Indies to Governor Cornwallis to bring to Halifax
some Protestant families from Martinique with their effects, if he
would give them protection and grant them lands, and the Governor
was furnished with a list of their names, with what each of them
was worth, which approached in all nearly £50,000. This gentleman
proceeded to Louisburg to obtain for them a passport, and
proposed to have his people on before winter; but it does not
appear as far as any information on the subject can be gathered
from the public records that any of these French Protestants ever
arrived.</p>

<p>The Government found it necessary to check the indiscriminate
sale of spirituous liquors by a license duty. On the 28th August
an ordinance passed for that purpose, and all such licensed houses
were to be closed at 9 p. m. under penalty. On the 31st August
the Governor and Council for the first time sat as a Court of Law.
This was named the General Court, all authority&mdash;legislative,
executive and judicial&mdash;being vested in the Board. They met on this
day for the trial of Abram Goodside, the Boatswain's mate of the
Beaufort, who stabbed and wounded two men. A grand jury was
summoned who found a bill of indictment; he was tried and found
guilty by a petit jury, and hanged under the Governor's warrant on
2nd September, 1749. On 31st August, another Court was held for
the trial of one Peter Cartal, for murder. The Acadian Deputies
having returned from the country, they were called before the
Governor and Council on September 6th, when they presented a
letter signed by 1000 inhabitants claiming to take only a qualified
Oath of Allegiance.</p>

<p>On the 30th August, a sloop from Liverpool, Great Britain, with
116 settlers, arrived after a passage of nine weeks. They were, however,
all quite healthy, not one person being sick on board at the time
of their arrival. Two streets were then added to the Town and lots
assigned to these people. This was Forman's new division. We
have no names of these settlers or the name of the sloop.</p>

<p>Information having reached the Government that the Indians of
Acadia and St. John's Island, designed to molest the settlement at
Halifax on the approach of winter,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> it was deemed advisable to erect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
outworks for its defence; accordingly the troops and inhabitants
were immediately employed to construct a line of palisades around
the town in connection with square log forts which were to be placed
at convenient distances. A space of thirty feet was cleared without
the lines, and the trees thrown up by way of a barricade, which
constituted a complete defence against any attempt on the part of
the Indians. Those settlers who had built their houses without the
town had arms given them, and their dwellings being built of logs
were musket proof; also the Ordnance Artificers, those from New
England and such of the settlers as had been in the army, and such
others as could be trusted with arms within the town, also received
them, and an order was sent to Boston for a supply of lamps to
light the streets during the winter nights. Col. Goreham was sent
to the head of the Basin with his company of Rangers for the winter,
with an armed sloop to assist him, and every preparation possible
was made for the protection of the people during the ensuing winter.</p>

<p>The Indians had appeared in the neighbourhood of the town for
several weeks, but intelligence had been received that they had commenced
hostilities, by the capture of twenty persons at Canso under
frivolous pretences, and of two vessels having been attacked by them
at Chignecto, when three English and seven Indians were killed.
In consequence of this information it was resolved in Council to
send a letter to M. Desherbiers, Governor of Louisburg, to recall
LeLoutre. On the last day of September they made an attack on the
sawmill at Dartmouth, then under the charge of Major Gilman.
Six of his men had been sent out to cut wood without arms. The
Indians laid in ambush, killed four and carried off one, and the
other escaped and gave the alarm, and a detachment of rangers was
sent after the savages, who having overtaken them, cut off the heads
of two Indians and scalped one.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>These proceedings compelled the government to take more active
measures, and orders were given to the commanding officers at the
out stations, to destroy the Indians wherever they met them, and
a premium of ten guineas was offered for every Indian killed or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
taken prisoner, this offer was in consequence of the large rewards
offered by the French to the Indians for English scalps. Orders
were given for raising two independent companies of rangers, one of
one hundred men by Major Gilman, who was sent to Piscataqua for
that purpose,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the other a company of volunteers by Captain Wm.
Clapham, who with Goreham's Indian Rangers, now returned from
their stations at the head of the Basin with a company of Philips'
Regiment, were to scour the whole country around the Bay. The
St. John Indians having kept the treaty, received from Governor
Cornwallis a present of 1000 bushels of corn, and an order was also
given to purchase at Minas 500 bushels of wheat, to be baked into
biscuit for the same purpose. Captain How was intrusted with
these and other presents, and was directed to bring back with him, if
possible, some of the tribe to go against the Mic-Macs. The
preparation necessary to the protection of the town against
French-Indian hostilities tended to expedite the progress of the
settlement; before the middle of October, about three hundred and
fifty houses had been completed, two of the square forts finished
and the barricade carried all around. A number of store houses
and barrack buildings for the accommodation of the troops had been
also erected and the Governor's residence completed. The Council
met there on the 14th October. About 30 of the French inhabitants
were employed on the Public Works, and in cutting a road from the
town to the Basin of Minas. A number of influential and
industrious families from New England and other places had
already become settlers, and Halifax Harbor was the resort of a
large number of fishing vessels.</p>

<p>About this time a destructive epidemic made its appearance in the
town, and it is said nearly 1000 persons fell victims during the
autumn and the following winter. On the 14th day of October, the
Government found it necessary to publish an ordinance, commanding
all Justices of the Peace, upon the death of the settlers, to name
so many of the neighbourhood or quarter (not exceeding 12) to
which the deceased belonged, to attend at the burial and carry the
corpse to the grave, and whoever refused to attend without sufficient
reason should have his name struck off the Mess Book and Register
of Settlers as unworthy of His Majesty's bounty; again in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
December, another order was made commanding all householders to
report their dead to a clergyman within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Owing to the frequent alarms of invasion from the Indians and
French stragglers during the winter, it was resolved in Council to
organize a militia force for the protection of the settlement, and on
the Sunday following the 6th day of December, after divine service,
all the male settlers, between the age of sixteen and sixty, were
assembled on the parade, and drawn up in the following order:&mdash;"Those
of Mr. Ewer's and Mr. Collier's divisions to face the harbor,
those of the quarters of Mr. Galland and Mr. Foreman to face the
Citadel, and those of Mr. Callendar's division at one end of the
parade." The proclamation bears date the 7th day of December,
1749. On the 16th, information arrived that a French force had
been dispatched overland from Canada, to attack Halifax, and that
the Indians were to co-operate with them, also, that two vessels
with six hundred men were in the Bay Verte under LeCorne, and
with ammunition and stores of all kinds for a winter expedition.
The people having been again assembled on the parade after divine
service, the proclamation was read and the settlers commanded to
fell all the trees around the town without the forts and barricades.
No attempt was, however, made upon the town, either by the Indians
or French during the winter. These hostilities were being carried
on by the Government of Canada, while the two Crowns were
nominally at peace, under pretence that the Treaty of Utrecht only
ceded to the Crown of Great Britain the peninsula of Nova Scotia
proper.</p>

<p>The Governor deeming it expedient that some permanent system of
judicial proceedings to answer the immediate exigencies of the
Colony should be established, a committee of Council was accordingly
appointed to examine the various systems in force in the old
Colonies. On 13th December, Mr. Green reported that after a
careful investigation, the laws of Virginia were found to be most
applicable to the present situation of the province. The report was
adopted. It referred principally to the judicial proceedings in the
General Courts, the County Courts, and other tribunals.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, which comprehends all that can
be collected relative to the affairs of the settlement during the first
year of its existence, it will be proper to observe that in founding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
the City, the spiritual wants of the settlers were not lost sight of by
the British Government. Preparatory to the embarkation of the
settlers, a letter was addressed by the Lords of Trade and Plantations
to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign
Parts, dated Whitehall, April 6th, 1749, recommending to the
Society to appoint ministers and school-masters for the new
settlement at Chebucto, and for such other townships or settlements
as should from time to time be formed in Nova Scotia, and requesting
the Society to make some provisions for them until arrangements
should be made for their sufficient support, by grants of land, etc.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The Society resolved immediately to act on this recommendation,
and undertook to send six clergymen and six school-masters, when the
settlements should be formed. The first missionaries appointed
under this arrangement, were the Rev. William Tutty, of Emmanuel
College, Cambridge, and the Rev. Mr. Anwell, who both came out
with the settlers in June, 1749. Mr. Tutty officiated in the open
air until the necessary church accommodation could be obtained. On
laying out the town, a spot was assigned by Government for the
church. The site was first selected at the north end of the Grand
Parade, where Dalhousie College now stands, but it was changed
immediately after for the present site of St. Paul's Church, which
was erected at the expense of Government and ready for the reception
of the missionary, who preached his first sermon there on the
2nd day of September, 1750. The pews and inside finish were not
completed for several years after. The name of Mr. Tutty does not
appear among those of the settlers who came with Cornwallis. He
probably, however, accompanied him. Mr. Anwell came with the
expedition, but his name does not again appear; he died shortly
after his arrival. Mr. Tutty spoke German and administered the
Lord's Supper to the German settlers in their own language. The
other missionary, J. Baptiste Moreau, who came out as school-master,
and afterwards went to England for ordination, returned to the settlement
and went down to Maligash with the Germans, 1752. Mr.
Halstead was the school-master in charge of the Society's schools at
Halifax during the first two or three years.</p>

<p>Governor Cornwallis in 1749, assigned the lot at the south-west
corner of Prince and Hollis streets for a Protestant Dissenting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
Meeting house. The old building known as Mather's, or as it was
afterwards called St. Matthew's Church (destroyed by fire in 1859,)
was soon after erected on this site. It was appropriated originally
to the Congregationalists, many of whom came from New England to
settle in Halifax. It was called Mather's Church after the celebrated
Cotton Mather, one of the leading divines of that denomination
at Boston, in early days. The Presbyterians, and all who did
not belong to the Established Church, attended divine service in this
building. The Rev. Mr. Cleveland, who came from one of the old
colonies, was the first minister who officiated in this building. It
afterwards fell into the hands of the Presbyterians and became the
property of the Church of Scotland, and the name of Mather's was
changed to that of St. Matthew. This old Church was destroyed
by fire, which consumed a large portion of the buildings in Hollis
Street, in 1859. The lot of ground on which it stood was afterwards
sold to Mr. Doull, who erected the fine stone store thereon,
now known as Doull and Miller's building.</p>

July, 1749, says: "The number of settlers&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;is 1,400, but I beg
leave to observe to your Lordships that amongst them the number of industrious,
active men proper to undertake and carry on a new settlement, is very small. Of
soldiers there are only 100, of tradesmen, sailors and others able and willing to work,
not above 200." The rest he reports as idle and worthless, persons who embraced the
opportunity to get provisions for a year without labour, or sailors who only wanted a
passage to New England, and that many were sick and unfit for settlers, and many
without sufficient clothing. He describes a few Swiss who were among the settlers,
as "regular, honest and industrious men," and observes that there are "indeed, many
come over of the best sort, who, though they do not work themselves, are useful in
managing the rest." "I have," he says, "appointed two or three of them as overseers
of each ship's company."</p></div>

Basin, near the small Cove about 4 miles from town, which still bears the name of the
French Landing. The Duke died of grief at the failure of the expedition, and the Vice
Admiral Destourville, ran himself through the body, and was buried on George's
Island. His remains, or what was supposed to be have been, were afterwards removed
to France by his family. Several of the ships of war were sunk on the eastern side of
the Basin. The hulls of these vessels were visible in calm weather about 50 years
ago, but they have long since disappeared. M. Jonquiare, afterwards Governor of
Canada, was also in this expedition.</p></div>

great form. After the treaty was ratified they received presents and went on board the

them a salute of 17 guns, as likewise they did on going aboard. They expressed a great

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>The winter of 1749-50, as has been before mentioned, was spent
in continual apprehension of Indian and French invasion, and in
preparations to receive the enemy. On the 7th January, 1750, a
number of the inhabitants petitioned that Martial Law should be
declared, but the Governor and Council did not consider the danger
so great or imminent as to make it necessary. However, stringent
regulations with regard to the militia were enacted, and an ordinance
was issued compelling all settlers able to bear arms between 16 and
60, to be formed into 10 companies of 70 men each,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and a guard
of &mdash; officers and 30 men to assemble every evening near the parade
to keep guard until sunrise, and all militia men called upon to labour
at the fortifications, were to be allowed 1s. per day. Labourers
were constantly employed in raising a barricade and continuing it to
the water side, and block houses were erected between the forts.</p>

<p>During the winter intelligence frequently arrived from Minas,
Pisiquid, and the eastern shore, of attacks being made by the Indians
upon stragglers, and several young Acadians were brought from
Minas to Halifax for trial, having been found in arms with the
Indians. A large reward was offered for the apprehension of
LeLoutre, the Indian missionary, and also £10 sterling for every
Indian scalp or Indian prisoner. Capt. Sylvanus Cobb, an active
and bold sea captain from Massachusetts, was taken into Government
employ, and sent to Chignecto with his armed sloop for the
purpose of surprising LeLoutre and his gang, and afterwards to
search the harbors along the coast for Indians, and bring with him
all he captured as prisoners to Halifax. Troops under Capt. Bartilo
and others were sent into the interior and other active proceedings
taken by the Governor and Council during the months of January
and February for the peace of the province. A courier having been
stopped at Cobequid, Priest Gourard and the French Deputies,
were all brought to Halifax, by Capt. Bartilo, for examination
before the Governor and Council; Gourard was detained at Government
House until the courier returned, but the deputies were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
dismissed. He disclosed the fact to the Council that the Mic-Mac
Indians of Nova Scotia went every year to Quebec, to receive
clothing from the French Government, and that LeCorn had made
the French of Acadia take the Oath of Allegiance to the French
King. Gourard on this occasion took the Oath of Allegiance to the
Crown of Great Britain, and thereupon received a licence to officiate
as Priest to the Acadians, and promised not to leave the province
without special leave from the Governor.</p>

<p>Among the municipal regulations this winter, was an ordinance
that all persons found breaking the liquor license law, should be
put one hour in the public stocks, and for the second offence receive
twenty lashes. These severe regulations were found to be absolutely
necessary, in consequence of the demoralized state of the settlement
from settlers and others who infested the town and who were not
settlers.</p>

<p>On the 2nd February, 1750, an ordinance was passed in Council,
prohibiting the recovery of any debt contracted in England or elsewhere
prior to the establishment of the settlement or to the debtor's
arrival in Halifax, in any Court of Law within the province, except
for goods imported into the Colonies. There appears to have been
some difference of opinion at the Board on the subject; the Council
divided, and the ordinance was carried by a small majority.</p>

<p>It was proposed in Council about this time, to build a quay along
the shore in front of the town, but several merchants&mdash;Mr. Saul,
Mr. Joshua Mauger and others, having applied for water lots, and
liberty to build wharves on the beach, the subject was referred to
Mr. Morris the surveyor, and Mr. Bruce the engineer. They
thought the quay was a work of time and required means from
England. Licences to build wharves were therefore granted, with a
reservation of the right of the Crown in case the quay should be
resolved on or the frontage required for government purposes. This
scheme was afterwards abandoned by Government, and the licences
remained unrepealed. At this period the line of the shore was so
irregular, as in some places to afford only a footpath between the
base line of the lots, which now form the upper side of Water Street
and high water mark;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> at the Market the tide flowed up nearly to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
where the [old] City Court House stood, forming a cove, the outlet
of a brook which came down north of George Street. Near the
Ordnance Yard another cove made in, and this part of the shore
was low and swampy many years after the batteries were built.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The winter passed without any attack on the settlement, and the
people were all quite healthy. The number of settlers was daily
augmented by almost every vessel which arrived from New England
and elsewhere; every thing required was provided for them, that
they should be tolerably comfortable before the cold weather set in.
The winter was very fine, very few extreme bad days, no heavy
snow storms, the navigation never stopped in the slightest degree.
More fine days and fewer bad ones (says the Governor) than I ever
saw in winter. Spring opened early with fine warm days and thaw,
and the fishing schooners began early in March to go upon the
Bank.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The snow lay all the winter, from the middle of January;
it was, however, only three feet deep in the woods. The healthy
condition of the settlers may be inferred from there never being
more than 25 in the hospital ship at any one time.</p>

<p>By the 19th March, a place had been erected for a public
Hospital, and a school building commenced for the orphan children.
The French from the interior engaged freely for money to square
timber for the erection of the blockhouses, and preparations were in
progress for the completion of the Church.</p>

<p>A meeting of the Governor and Council took place on 19th April,
when the French Deputies again appeared with a petition to be
permitted to sell their lands and leave the country. The names of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
these deputies were Jaques Teriot from Grand Pre, Francois
Granger from River de Canard, Battiste Galerne and Jean André.</p>

<p>Mr. Cornwallis was continually embarrassed by letters from the
Board of Trade, finding fault with the expenses incurred in planting
the settlement. £40,000 had been voted by Parliament, and £36,000
of excess had been demanded as a further vote; this could
not be considered so great an expenditure under all the circumstances,
as it included the pay and equipment of two regiments of
infantry. In his replies, he says, "Not a pound shall be expended
by me unnecessarily, but without money you could have had no
town, no settlement, and indeed no settlers. 'Tis very certain that
the public money cleared the ground, built the town, secured it,
kept both soldiers and settlers from starving with cold, and has
brought down above 1000 settlers from the other Colonies. Lots
in Halifax are now worth 50 guineas. If there was no public
money circulating, lots would be given for a gallon of rum. The
money is laid out in building forts, barracks, store houses,
hospitals, churches, wharves, etc., public works all that seem
absolutely necessary. According to your Lordship's directions, I
have discharged the two Government Apothecaries and shall discharge
some of the Surgeons' Mates that may be spared. As for
the saw mill, we never had one board from it&mdash;it has been a constant
plague from the beginning. Thirty men have been constantly kept
there ever since the affair of the Indians. Gilman has behaved so
ill I shall have to discharge him from all service. I have laid in a
quantity of lumber in the King's yard this spring at a reasonable
price. For want of stock I have been sometimes obliged to pay
£5 per M. The settlers have paid £6. I have got them lately at
£3 10s., £3 and £2 15s. No new boards are given to settlers."</p>

<p>The salaries to the public officers of Cornwallis' Government
appear exceedingly small in comparison with the arduous duties
which devolved upon them in organizing the settlement. His Aides-de-Camp,
Capt. Bulkely and Mr. Gates,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> had no allowance except
some trifling commission on the issue of molasses and spirits.</p>

<p>In June, 1750, the Governor and Council assigned as a site the
spot on which the [old] City Court House stands, for a market
for black cattle, sheep, etc., and made market regulations. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
July, the settlers were ordered to clear the streets in front of their
respective lots to the centre. They had begun to clear George's
Island and to erect block-houses. Seven 32-pounders had been
mounted upon it, and a palisade carried all around the works. The
frame of the Church, which had been brought from Boston, was
erected and was being covered in, the estimated cost of finishing
the edifice being £1000 sterling. The temporary barricades were
removed, and the palisades carried completely round the town.
30,000 bricks had been manufactured in the neighbourhood and
found very good. The meeting house for Dissenters had not yet
been commenced. The town was increasing every day in settlers
and the number of its houses, but no improvement of the lands in
the neighbourhood had been made beyond a few small gardens.
The fishery was prosperous and produced 25,000 quintals the first
year.</p>

<p>In the month of August, 1750, three hundred and fifty-three
settlers arrived in the ship Alderney; and in September following,
three hundred German Protestants, from the Palatinate, in the ship
Ann. The Governor and Council were embarrassed in providing
for their support, and found it necessary to enter into pecuniary
arrangements with the merchants of the town, who at this early
period had formed themselves into an association for the benefit of
trade. Those who came in the ship Alderney, were sent to the
opposite side of the harbour, and commenced the town of Dartmouth,
which was laid out in the autumn of that year. In December
following, the first ferry was established, and John Connor
appointed ferryman by order in Council.</p>

<p>In the spring of the following year the Indians surprised Dartmouth
at night, scalped a number of settlers and carried off
several prisoners. The inhabitants, fearing an attack, had cut
down the spruce trees around their settlement, which, instead of a
protection, as was intended, served as a cover for the enemy.
Captain Clapham and his company of Rangers were stationed on
Block-house hill, and it is said remained within his block-house
firing from the loop-holes, during the whole affair. The Indians
were said to have destroyed several dwellings, sparing neither
women nor children. The light of the torches and the discharge of
musketry alarmed the inhabitants of Halifax, some of whom put off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
to their assistance, but did not arrive in any force till after the
Indians had retired. The night was calm, and the cries of the
settlers, and whoop of the Indians were distinctly heard on the
western side of the harbour. On the following morning, several
bodies were brought over&mdash;the Indians having carried off the
scalps.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Mr. Pyke, father of the late John George Pyke, Esq.,
many years police magistrate of Halifax, lost his life on this
occasion. Those who fled to the woods were all taken prisoners but
one. A court martial was called on the 14th May, to inquire into
the conduct of the different commanding officers, both commissioned
and non-commissioned, in permitting the village to be plundered
when there were about 60 men posted there for its protection.</p>

<p>There was a guard house and small military post at Dartmouth
from the first settlement, and a gun mounted on the point near the
saw mill (in the cove) in 1749. One or two transports, which had
been housed over during winter and store ships were anchored in the
cove, under the cover of this gun, and the ice kept broke around them
to prevent the approach of the Indians. The attempt to plant a
settlement at Dartmouth, does not appear to have been at first very
successful. Governor Hobson in his letter to the Board of Trade,
dated 1st October, 1753, says, "At Dartmouth there is a small town
well picketed in, and a detachment of troops to protect it, but there are
not above five families residing in it, as there is no trade or fishing
to maintain any inhabitants, and they apprehend danger from the
Indians in cultivating any land on the outer side of the pickets."</p>

<p>There is no record of any concerted attack having been made by
the Indians or French on the town of Halifax. Many stragglers
were cut off during the first years of the settlement, particularly
along the western side of the Basin, where the best firewood was to
be obtained. It was at length found necessary to send out an
armed body when fuel or lumber was required. The enemy usually
retired before a regular organized force. The Ranger companies
under Goreham and Bartelo, were most efficient for this purpose;
they were usually recruited in New England, where men for that
service were more readily found.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
The German settlers who came in the ship Ann, were employed
in the public works at 2s. per day, besides a supply of beer and
other liquors to each. It was decided that all settlers who came in
the previous year, should cease to draw provisions after the 15th
September, 1750. This order was afterwards repealed on 29th, and it
was determined that all settlers already in the town or who should
come before 1st December, should be entitled to one year's provisions
from the time of their names being entered on the victualling
book.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>It was the intention of Government that the Germans should be
sent into the interior of the province; but they having arrived so late
in the season, and the want of a sufficient supply of provisions then
in store to sustain them through the winter rendered it impossible,
and they were retained in the town. They were very sickly, many
of them old and unfit for settlers, and their passages not being paid,
and there being no person to purchase them, they were employed on
the public works to work out their passage money.</p>

<p>About this period a gloom was cast over the settlement by the
news of the murder of the Hon. Edward How, one of the Council at
Chignecto. "Captain How was employed on the expedition to
Chignecto as knowing the country well and being acquainted both
with the Indians and the inhabitants, and furthermore he knew
personally their leaders, LeCorne and LeLoutre. His whole
aim and study was to obtain a peace with the Indians, and
get the English prisoners out of their hands, for which purpose he
often had conferences with the French officers under a flag of
truce. LeCorne one day sent a flag of truce by a French officer
to the water side, a small river which parts his people from the
British troops. Capt. How and the officers held a parley for some
time across the river. How had no sooner taken leave of the
officers than a party that lay in ambush fired a volley at him and
shot him through the heart, an instance of treacherous brutality
not to be paralleled in history, and a violation of a flag of truce,
which had ever been held sacred, and without which all faith is at
an end, and all transactions with an enemy."&mdash;[Cornwallis' letter
27th November.]</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
The spring of 1751 the five acre lots on the Peninsula were laid
out; the people engaged in clearing the land. The uncertainty from
surprise by Indians, however, much retarded the work; a large space,
however, was cleared around the town before winter set in.</p>

<p>Another vessel having arrived on the 10th June, with German
Palatine settlers, they were directed to be employed at Dartmouth in
picketing in the back of the town. In July, the arrival of 200 more
was reported, and they were ordered to be placed at the head of the
N. W. Arm and mouth of the Basin; and those who owed work for
their passage, were directed to picket in their stations. Monsieur
Dupacquir, who had engaged to bring out 300 Swiss, brought but
twenty this year, but more were expected in the following spring.</p>

<p>Ninth July, a proclamation issued to forfeit all lots of the town
settlers who only put up slight frames of houses, unless they
immediately proceeded to board them in and finish them as
dwellings.</p>

<p>On the 18th June, Jas. Stephens and Wm. Harris were hanged for
house-breaking; this was the second public execution which took
place in the town.</p>

<p>William Piggot had a license granted him to open a coffee house
on the 8th April the same year.</p>

<p>In January of this year the Council passed a series of regulations
for the General Court and County Courts, and ordered them to be
published by the Provost Marshal by reading the same after the
beat of drum through the settlement, and on the first day of the
next sitting of the General Court and County Courts.</p>

<p>The only matters further recorded worthy of notice during the
year 1751, was the dismissal of Mr. Otis Little, the Commissary of
Stores, for remissness in his office, and the resolution of the
Governor and Council to pay a draft for £882, sent from Quebec,
for the ransom of English prisoners taken by the Indians and
carried to Canada. It appeared that Lt. Hamilton and upwards of
sixty officers, soldiers and settlers had fallen into the hands of the
savages, and Priest LeLoutre had agreed to ransom them for the sum
above mentioned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
It may here be mentioned that several batteries have already been
erected on George's Island,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and expensive earth works had been
thrown up.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year Mr. Joshua Mauger, a gentleman
from England, who came out at the commencement of the settlement
to trade and distil rum for the soldiers, was charged by government
with having attempted to make Halifax the repository for Louisburg
merchandize, brought up secretly and to be carrying on an illicit
traffic, he being at the time agent victualler to Government.
Governor Cornwallis, upon information, caused Mr. Mauger's stores
to be searched for contraband articles brought from Louisburg.
Much discussion ensued, and the settlement was for some time
thrown into commotion, by what Mr. Mauger called in his letter to
England, the high-handed proceedings of the Governor.</p>

There were five forts, having each four quadrangular blockhouses, with a barrack in
the centre; these were connected by wooden palisades or pickets.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> A number of licences to erect wharves and buildings along the beach had been
granted by Government to individuals engaged in trade and the fishery, before the idea
of a general Government breastwork had been abandoned. These titles continued to be
held good; a number of wharf proprietors, however, obtained conformation grants from
time to time as they required water extension. Mr. Charles Morris, the Surveyor-General,
who had the sole management of the land office, in his reports to the Government,
advised small spaces to be reserved on both sides in making these conformation
grants as well as in subsequent water grants in fee, which have been found of much
inconvenience to trade, and a drawback on the progress of the City. No reservation of
water was originally made at the foot of the cross streets or hills. At the close of the
last and the commencement of the present century, when conformation or extension
water grants were asked for, he marked on his plans narrow strips or reservations on
the sides of many of these water grants, which for there being in many instances
inaccessible, have since proved of no value to the public and a great injury to the
proprietors of water property.</p></div>

<p>In January, 1752, Mr. Collier, who had been acting as Chief
Justice, and Captain Frotheringham, were called to the Council in
place of Mr. Salisbury and Col. Horseman, who had returned to
England. On 3rd February, a public ferry was established between
Halifax and Dartmouth and John Connors appointed ferryman for
three years, with the exclusive privilege, and ferry regulations were
also established. At the same sitting of the Council, an order was
passed for the recording of deeds and mortgages, making all papers
unrecorded void against those which had been registered. Col.
Horseman's stone building was purchased for a prison in place of
that before used.</p>

<p>April 29th, Charles Morris, James Monk, John Duport, Robert
Ewer, Joseph Scott, John Wm. Hoffeman and Leonard Christopher
Redolf were appointed Justices of the Peace. It was resolved in
Council at their sitting on 12th June, that a lottery should be held
for building a Light House near Cape Sambro, to raise £450.
One thousand tickets at £3 each. Prizes from one of £500 to £7
the lowest. Two hundred prizes, in all amounting to £3000, 15 per
cent. to be deducted from the prizes, to be drawn publicly in the
Town House at Halifax, under the direction of managers to be
appointed by Government.</p>

<p>The winter of 1751-2 had been severe, but the harbour had not
been frozen or at all impeded by ice, and the spring opened early,
and preparations for prosecuting the fishery were soon in active
operation.</p>

<p>The Government mills at Dartmouth, under charge of Captain
Clapham, were sold at auction in June. They were purchased by
Major Gilman for £310.</p>

<p>16th July&mdash;An order passed to strike off the victualling lists all
the German and Swiss settlers, who had arrived in the Speedwell.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1752, a number of settlers arrived in the Nancy,
under the charge of Lt. Young. About the same time the Marquis
DeConte, a Sicilian nobleman, and a number of other foreign
settlers, came to Halifax from the island of Tercera, one of the
Azores, and settled in the town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
Governor Cornwallis having obtained permission to resign the
Government, the Hon. Peregrine T. Hopson, was appointed his
successor, and was sworn into office before the Council on Monday,
3rd August. Mr. Cornwallis, however, did not leave the province
until after the 10th of October, as he appears to have attended the
Council held on that day.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In September, 1752, John Baptist Cope, commonly called Major
Cope, a Mic-Mac chief, head of the Shubenacadie Indians, came in
with terms of peace, which were agreed to. This bears date the 15th
September, in that year. Immediately after this document was
signed, Cope left town in a vessel, having requested Capt. W.
Piggot should be sent to Indian Harbour, to meet the Indians there,
to ratify the Treaty. Mr. Piggot was accordingly dispatched, and
brought up with him two or three Indians, who appeared before the
Council, after which they were sent back to Beaver Harbour, under
the conduct of Mr. Piggot, with blankets, provisions, etc. The
terms of the Treaty were agreed to and confirmed in Council, and
the whole was engrossed on parchment and ratified on 22nd
November, 1752. The names of the Indian delegates on this
occasion were, Andrew Hodley Martin, Gabriel Martin and Francis
Jeremiah. Mr. Saul received directions to issue provisions, according
to the allowance of the troops for six months, for 90 Indians,
that being the number of the tribe under Cope, occupying the
eastern part of the province.</p>

<p>This treaty does not appear to have been respected by the Indian
Chief, who we find, not more that eight months after its ratification,
refusing to respect the pass of Governor Hopson to one Anthony
Cartel, who had been captured by the Indians, in one of the harbours
eastward of Halifax, and carried through the country to Shubenacadie,
the head-quarters of Major Cope, from whom he was
ransomed by a French inhabitant. It would appear that the terms
of amity, entered into by Cope and his men with the Government at
Halifax, had been in some manner without the sanction of Abbe
LeLoutre, who, when Anthony Cartel was brought before Count<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
Raymond at Louisburg, was present, and as Cartel expresses it,
inveighed bitterly against Governor Cornwallis, and said if he
wanted peace he ought to have written to him, and not to have
treated with the tribe of Indians. That he, Cartel, might depart,
having been ransomed, but that the first Englishman he caught
should be retained until he, LeLoutre, had full satisfaction for himself
and his Indians.</p>

<p>In April following, two men named John Connor and James
Grace, arrived at Halifax in an Indian canoe, bringing with them
six Indian scalps. They informed the Council that they and two
others, having put into a place between Tor Bay and Country
Harbour, in a schooner, were captured by the Indians, and carried
ten miles into the country, where their two companions were
murdered; that they had surprised the Indians at night, killed
several, whose scalps they secured, and having escaped to the
seaside, seized a canoe, and made their way to Halifax. Along the
coast, both east and west from Halifax, Indian massacres had been
frequent. Those persons engaged in the fishery, who were compelled
to land for wood and water, were chiefly the sufferers.</p>

<p>Much had been said and written in Europe at the time, relative to
the aggressions of the French, during the suspension of hostilities
between the two nations. The Indians, from their religion and
trading intercourse, more favourable to the French in Canada and
Acadia, were made use of to harass the British settlers, who
(though the two nations were then at peace) were looked upon with
a jealous eye by the resident French population. A French writer,
(I refer to a little work, now a scarce book, published during the
second siege of Louisburg), states that the English neglected to
cultivate an acquaintance with the manners and customs of the
Indians, and it was therefore not surprising at the time, that they
should show less affection towards them than towards the French,
who had great regard to their humours and inclinations.</p>

<p>"So strong is their aversion to despotic power," says the author,
"that force will never do; they will yield to nothing but persuasion.
Though they know nothing of precepts or subordination, yet they
enjoy almost every advantage derived from well-regulated authority.
Their laws and customs appear impressed on their hearts. In order
to gain an ascendancy over them, you must gain their esteem, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
they never confide in a person whom they do not value, and this
esteem is very difficult to obtain."</p>

<p>The savages were exasperated against the English by a speech
delivered by Count Raymond, at a meeting of the chiefs, in which, to
suit his own purposes, he depicted the most frightful cruelties perpetrated
by the English.</p>

<p>During the Indian hostilities, opposition on the part of the
Colonists was altogether of a defensive nature. The regular troops,
as well as the undisciplined militia, proving unfit for such warfare,
it was found necessary to employ the New England Rangers. These
were volunteers from the New England provinces, accustomed to
Indian warfare, many of them Indians and half-bloods. They
ascended the rivers, penetrated into the heart of the province, and
attacked the enemy in their strongholds. The Indians finding they
were opposed by men equally accustomed to the forest with themselves,
soon found it their interest to make peace with the British.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>In 1758, it was found necessary to procure the services of 250 of
these Rangers from New England, by promises of high pay and
other advantages. Long accustomed to the border war with the
Indians and French of Canada, they had become well disciplined,
and accustomed to hardships and fatigue, and were perhaps at this
time superior to all other provincial troops in America. The
Provincials were troops raised in the Colonies at the expense of the
Provincial Government, and were distinct from the Rangers, who
were independent companies paid by the British Government. They
served at Havannah, at Louisburg in the first siege under Pepperell,
and with Wolfe at Louisburg and Quebec, and afterwards served to
form the groundwork of Washington's army in 1775.</p>

<p>After the fall of Fort William Henry in 1758, it was said that the
Marquis de Montcalm sent a number of prisoners taken at that
place, in a vessel to Halifax. They were Provincial soldiers,
chiefly from the New England provinces. This was said to have
been an attempt to introduce the small pox into Halifax, many of the
men being ill of the disorder on their embarkation. Providence,
however, frustrated this benevolent design. The prisoners being
kept on low diet, half starved, and exposed to the cold, soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
recovered, while the French in charge of the vessel, having indulged
in the use of wine and strong fare, were thrown down with the
disease, and nearly all perished. The vessel was brought into port
by the prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In the spring of 1751, nine hundred and fifty-eight Protestant
German settlers arrived, and in the following year 1000 more.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
The latter were from Montbeliard, of the Confession of Augsburgh,
and were placed under the spiritual charge of the Rev. J. B.
Moreau. They had been induced to emigrate by promises from
King George II, which it is said were never realized. Considerable
difficulty appears to have been experienced by the Government in
providing a suitable situation for settling so large a number of
persons. The original design with regard to the foreign Protestants
was to place them in the interior of the country, on the lands
unoccupied by the French Acadians, it being supposed that their
proximity to and intercourse with the French, would be the means
of lessening the bad feeling which had been fostered by emissaries
from Canada. The project was unfavorably received by the
Acadians. There were, however, other difficulties in the way of its
accomplishment, of a particular nature, which compelled the Government
to abandon the object. The want of sufficient provisions to
maintain so many settlers through the winter, the lateness of the
season, and the helplessness of a large portion of the Germans, who
were unfit for labour, induced the Government to place them in the
neighbourhood of Halifax. It was at first proposed in Council to
send them to the opposite side of the harbour over against George's
Island, and Captain Morris was sent to survey the grounds. The
mouth of Musquodoboit River was also suggested, and a survey of
that part of the country ordered, but the distance from Halifax and
the danger of the Indians, rendered the scheme impracticable. "All
I could do," says the Governor, "was to build boarded barracks
for them. They must be sustained by Government until they are
capable of raising something of their own; most of them are poor
and wretched, and have scarce a farthing of money among them."</p>

<p>These people had been collected together by a Mr. Dick, the
Government agent for that purpose. He had persuaded these who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
came out this year to sell everything they possessed even to their
bedding, before going on board; and they stated that owing to the
want of bedding and other conveniences, many of them died on the
passage and since their arrival. Many of these people are represented
as very old, and as objects fitter to be kept in almshouses,
several of them above 80 years of age. The Governor in his letter
to the Board of Trade, says, "On the 26th September last, when
the last of these settlers were landed, there were 30 of them who
could not stir off the beach, and among the children there were 8
orphans, who in twelve days increased to 14 by the death of their
parents. These had to be removed to the public orphan house, and
had the best care taken of them." Many of these settlers became
discontented with their condition, and went off to the Island of St.
John, where they endeavoured to settle themselves. The difficulty
of procuring provisions was very great. The Government appears
to have been altogether dependent on the contracts of Althorp and
Hancock of Boston, and Delaney and Watts of New York, for the
necessary supplies for the settlement.</p>

<p>In June, 1753, about 1500 of these German settlers embarked
for Malagash Harbour, west of Mahone Bay, where they afterwards
built the town of Lunenburg. They were accompanied by a
company of Rangers under Major Goreham. The expedition was
placed under the command of Col. Charles Lawrence. There were
also some regular troops, under Major Patrick Sutherland, who took
a very active part in planting the settlement. Lieutenant John
Creighton, of Warburton's Regiment, also accompanied the German
settlers, and also the Rev. J. H. Moreau, who officiated as their
minister.</p>

<p>The Lunenburg settlers were placed under similar regulations
with those at Halifax, and received Government allowance for
several years after their arrival at Malagash.</p>

<p>After the removal of the Germans from Halifax to Lunenburg,
there were but 15 German families left in the north suburbs. Not
knowing any English, they formed themselves into a separate
congregation for religious worship, and built themselves a small
house upon the German burial ground on Brunswick street, in which
they had prayers every Sunday. In 1760, a steeple was built on
this house, and the next year the Rev. Dr. Breynton, Rector of St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
Paul's, preached there for the first time, and it was on that occasion
dedicated by the name of St. George's Church. The congregation
followed the English Church rules of doctrine and appointed their
Elders and Vestry. This old building still remains in its primitive
state, the only monument now remaining of the old German settlement,
called Dutchtown.</p>

<p>In October, 1752, Mr. Cotterall was appointed to the Council,
and John Duport sworn in Clerk of the Council. An order in
Council and proclamation appeared on the 14th of November,
forbidding persons from assembling or carrying about effigies on the
anniversary of the holiday, called Gunpowder Treason, being the
16th of November, according to the alteration of the style.</p>

<p>At the Council held on the 22nd December, 1752, the Justices
were ordered to look out for a proper place for a bridewell or workhouse,
and to form a plan for the building of a block-house for that
purpose, and to obtain an estimate of the probable expense, and to
report rules and regulations for the government of the same. The
Constables were to go about the streets on Sundays to prevent
disorders, and to make a report to the Justices in the evening after
divine service, and to apprehend disorderly persons during the
night. Proprietors of land were obliged to fence their quota; on
failure, to be liable to an action for the recovery of the charges for
fencing the same.</p>

<p>All proprietors of land upon the peninsula of Halifax were
directed to clear half their lots by 1st May, 1753, to clear the
remainder and fence the whole by 1st May, 1754, otherwise the lots
would be forfeited and be disposed of to others who would improve
them. And an order was made for permission to John Connors, to
assign the Dartmouth Ferry to Henry Wynne and William
Manthorne.</p>

<p>Among the local events recorded this year, was a robbery in one
of the King's storehouses, which was broken open on the night of
the 26th October. There was also a cartel published by Governor
Hopson, for the exchange of prisoners with the French Government
in Canada.</p>

<p>The most important circumstance of the year, however, was a
charge against the Justices of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas,
sent in to the Council by a number of the most influential inhabitants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
charging them with partiality, and praying for a public
hearing. This document was presented to the Council in December,
and was signed by Joshua Mauger, Joseph Rundel, Isaac Knott, John
Grant, Francis Martin, Edward Crawley, Richard Catherwood,
Robert Campbell, William Nesbitt, John Webb, William McGee,
Sebastian Zouberbuhler, Samuel Sellon and Isaac Deschamps.
These charges came on for hearing before the Council on 3rd
January following; they consisted of ten distinct charges against
Charles Morris, James Monk, John Duport, Robert Ewer and
William Bourn, Esquires, Justices of the Inferior Court of Common
Pleas, for the Town and County of Halifax, and were signed by the
following inhabitants:</p>

<ul>
<li>Joshua Mauger,</li>
<li>S. Zouberbuhler,</li>
<li>Samuel Sellon,</li>
<li>Edward Buckleton,</li>

<li>Roger Hill,</li>
<li>Js. Deschamps,</li>
<li>Robert Grant,</li>
<li>William McGee,</li>
<li>Joseph Rundel.</li>
</ul>

<p>This affair arose from a dispute which occurred between the
Government and Captain Ephraim Cook, who had been discharged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
from the Commission of the Peace by Governor Cornwallis for bad
behaviour, and appears to have been the result of party feeling.</p>

<p>It resulted in additional numbers being added to the bench of
Magistrates, and the Governor and Council availed themselves of
this affair to urge upon the Government the necessity of having a
Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The necessity of a properly organized Militia force being kept up,
had become apparent, in consequence of the continual threats of
hostility on the part of the Indians and native French; it was therefore
resolved on 22 March, 1753, that a Militia should be raised
and established for the security of the Province, and a proclamation
was accordingly issued, compelling all persons (except foreigners,
who were to be placed elsewhere) between the ages of 16 and 60, to
serve in the Militia.</p>

<p>On the first day of June, another proclamation was issued for a
muster of the Militia. Those of the south suburbs to assemble
within the pickets opposite the end of Barrington Street, near
Horseman's Fort. Those of the north suburbs, between the Grenadier
Fort and Lutteral's Fort, and those of the town on the
esplanade, near the Citadel Hill.</p>

<p>On the 12th of April, 1753, Glaude Gisigash, an Indian who
styled himself Governor of LaHave, appeared before the Council,
and having declared his intention of making peace, terms of amity
were drawn up and signed by the Governor and the Indian Chief, on
the part of himself and his people. The terms were the same as
those made with Major Cope, and it was arranged that some of his
tribe should come up and ratify the treaty.</p>

<p>Governor Hopson went home on leave in the autumn of 1753, and
the government was administered by Col. Lawrence. In one of his
last letters to the Board of Trade, in reference to the disturbed state
of the country, Governor Hopson says, "Your Lordships may
imagine how disagreeable it is to me to see His Majesty's rights
encroached upon, and those encroachments openly avowed and
supported by the Governors of Canada and Louisburg, when it is
not in my power to prevent it. I have barely a sufficient force to
protect the settlers from the insults of an Indian war, under
pretence of which the French take all opportunity to commit
hostilities upon His Majesty's subjects. I am informed that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
French have often been mixed among them in the expeditions,
and am convinced past doubt that they are fed and protected from
our pursuit, and are encouraged to disturb us as openly and in as
great a degree as in time of war."</p>

<p>There were three still houses in Halifax in 1753. Mr. Best the
master mason, and Mr. Clewley the master carpenter, having been
ordered to inspect them. The return was as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mr. Richard Bowers, 2 stills in Granville Street.</li>
<li>Wm. Murray, 1 still in Grafton Street, reported not safe.</li>
<li>Jonathan Gifford, 1 still in Barrington Street.</li>
</ul>

<p>October 16th, Mr. John Greenwood presented a petition to the
Council, stating that he had paid passage for 12 men, 1 woman and
2 children, foreign settlers, with the Governor's leave. They
engaged to serve him for a year, but having been removed to
Lunenburg by the Governor's orders, he lost their services; he was
allowed £79 5s., the labour of 12 men for 96 days.</p>

<p>Governor Hopson took leave of the Council on 26th October, and
received an address on his departure. He sailed for England on the
2nd November following.</p>

<p>On the 16th November, two Indians appeared before the Council,
who had been sent from Lunenburg by Col. Sutherland. They stated
they were of the tribe of Cape Sable Indians, which consisted of
about 60 people with two chiefs; that Baptiste Thomas, one of
their priests, was one of their chiefs, and the other Francis Jean de
Perisse was not a chief, but deputed by the other chief. They
stated that they had never joined with the other Indians to molest
the English; that on the contrary they had always exhibited a
friendly spirit, in consequence of which they had never received any
assistance from the French. The Council gave them 2000 pounds
of bread, 3 barrels of pork, 20 blankets, 30 pounds powder, some
shot, tobacco and other articles, also two gold-laced hats for their
chiefs, and one silver-laced for the deputy.</p>

<p>The close of this year was occupied by the Governor and Council,
in investigation of the riots which occurred at Lunenburg, known as
the Hoffman Rebellion. It was found necessary to send Col.
Monkton with a body of regular troops to suppress the riots. Mr.
Hoffman, the supposed ringleader, was brought to Halifax and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
imprisoned on George's Island. He was afterwards tried and
sentenced to a fine of £100 or two years imprisonment.</p>

<p>It may be proper to advert to the religious condition of the settlement
at this period. The greater portion of the inhabitants were
at this time of the Church of England. The Protestant Germans had
nearly all united themselves to that Church, and sought missionaries
from the S. P. G. Society.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Breynton succeeded Mr. Tutty in St. Paul's. In
1752, he reported that half of the population had professed themselves
members of the Church, and that the actual communicants
were between 500 and 600.</p>

<p>Mr. Breynton established an Orphan House, and the Orphan
School was under his superintendence. In 1753, fifty poor children
were diligently instructed. Ralph Sharrock was the school-master.
In 1753, the Rev. Thomas Wood from the Province of New Jersey,
was appointed to assist Mr. Breynton, and he remained jointly in
charge with Mr. Breynton until 1763, when he was removed to
Annapolis.</p>

<p>It may here be observed, that on the establishment of Representative
Government at Halifax, in 1758, among the first acts of
the Assembly, was that for the support of Religious Worship, which
contained a clause for the free toleration of all Protestant dissenters,
whether Lutherans, Calvinists, etc., completely exempting them
from all charges for the support of the Established Church. By
this act, the right of the parishioners of St. Paul's and all future
parishes, to present their own minister to the ordinary for induction
was declared, and immediately after its publication, the parishioners
of the parish of St. Paul's, in the Town of Halifax, presented the
Reverend John Breynton and the Reverend Thomas Wood as joint
Rectors, or "Rector and Vicar," as they were called, to the
Governor, who immediately went through the form of induction, a
ceremony thought necessary in order to entitle them to privileges of
incumbents. The record of this fact will be found in the correspondence
of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel at that
period.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1753-4, there had been no disturbance from
the Indians, and the Government availed themselves of the opportunity
of sending out proper persons to make a survey of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
country around. The winter was mild and the frost not so severe
as usual or of so long continuance. The valley of the Shubenacadie
had been examined, but it was not found available for
settlement, being the principal resort of the Indians under Cope.
The Township of Lawrencetown including Chezzetcook, had also
been undertaken, and further grants of land in that quarter of the
country were sought for in the following spring.</p>

<p>The desertion of many of the lower orders of the German settlers
at Lunenburg is mentioned; they appear to have gone over to the
French. Governor Lawrence in his letter to the Board of Trade,
August 1st, 1754, speaking of the French, says, "They have not
for a long time brought anything to our markets, but on the other
hand have carried everything to the French and Indians."</p>

<p>At this time the land was being cleared for the Battery at the east
side of the harbour, the site probably of the present eastern battery.
A fort was also in progress of erection at Lawrencetown when the
settlement was progressing, not having been disturbed by the
Indians. This settlement had been formed by Governor Lawrence
in consequence of the good meadow lands at the head of the
harbour, and he granted the township to 20 proprietors and built a
blockhouse for their protection. But the undertaking was not
prosperous, and finally failed to answer the object intended, owing
to its exposed situation and the distance from Halifax.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Vulture, sloop-of-war, Capt. Kenzey, from the
Bay of Fundy, produced much excitement in the Town; she brought
several prisoners charged with murder, who were lodged in jail to
take their trial before the General Court.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Benjamin Street, Samuel Thornton and John Pastree, were placed
on their trial for the murder of one of the midshipmen and a sailor
of the Vulcan. It appeared on the trial that a schooner, of which
the parties charged were part of the crew, commanded by one
Hovey, belonging to Boston or some part of New England, was
found trading in the Bay of Fundy and supplying the French with
provisions, etc. Capt. Kenzey sent a boat aboard Hovey's shallop,
under the idea that he had contraband goods on board. The crew
refused to allow the man-of-war boat to come alongside, and fired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
into her, killing Mr. Jolly and wounding several others. Hovey,
the master, appears to have gone below and hid himself during the
whole affair. He was discovered in his berth by the officer in command
of the man-of-war boat, after the sloop had been captured.
This affair occurred in July, 1754, and the trial took place before
the Chief Justice in Michaelmas Term of that year. This was the
first sitting at which Chief Justice Belcher presided. The three
prisoners were acquitted of the murder, but it would appear they
were found guilty of the minor offence, as they were sentenced to
six months imprisonment, and afterwards placed on board a man-of-war
(1755). Joseph Hovey, the master, was discharged, the
grand jury refusing to find a bill of indictment against him.</p>

<p>The following appointments were made by the grand jury in
Michaelmas Term, 1754: Gaugers of Casks, Paul Pritchard and
Lewis Piers; Surveyors of Pickled Fish, Henry Ferguson and Daniel
Hills; Cullers of Dry Fish, Charles King and E. Gerrott; Cullers
of Hoops and Staves, Dennis Heffernan and Benoni Bartlett;
Surveyors of Lumber, etc., Joseph Scott and Joseph Marshall;
Surveyors of Cordwood, Samuel McClure, Josiah Milliken and
Joseph Wakefield.</p>

<p>On Monday 14th October, 1754, Jonathan Belcher, Esq., was
sworn in Chief Justice. The Court then adjourned to the Court
House, where His Majesty's Commission was read, appointing Lt.
Governor Lawrence, Governor General of the province. Mr.
Belcher's appointment bears date in July. At the commencement
of Michaelmas Term, the following ceremonies and procession were
observed, the first of the kind ever seen in Nova Scotia. On the
first day of Michaelmas Term, the Chief Justice walked from the
Governor's house honoured by the presence of His Excellency
Charles Lawrence, Esq., Lieutenant Governor, and accompanied by
the Honourable the Members of H. M. Council, proceeded by the
Provost Marshal, the Judge's tipstaff, and other civil officers, the
gentlemen of the Bar attending in their gowns, and walking in
procession to the long room at Pontach's, where an elegant breakfast
was provided, where the Chief Justice in his scarlet robes, was
received and complimented in the politest manner, by a great
number of gentlemen and ladies, and officers of the Army. Breakfast
being over, they proceeded with the commission before them, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
church, where an excellent sermon was preached by the Rev. Mr.
Breynton, from these words: "I am one of them that are peaceable
and faithful in Israel." A suitable anthem was sung, after which
they proceeded to the Court House, which upon this occasion was
very handsomely fitted up, where the Chief Justice being seated
with his Excellency the Lieutenant Governor on his right hand
under a canopy, the clerk of the Crown presented His Majesty's
commission to the Chief Justice, appointing him to be Chief Justice
within the province, which being returned, and proclamation for
silence being made, the same was read, and directions were given
by the Chief Justice for the conduct of the practitioners, and the
Grand Jury appearing in Court upon the return of the precept, were
sworn and charged by the Chief Justice, and the business of the day
being finished, the Court adjourned. His Honor the Chief Justice,
accompanied and attended as before, returned to the Governor's
house. A few days after Mr. Chief Justice Belcher, the Provost
Marshal, the gentlemen of the Bar, and other officers of H. M.
Supreme Court, and the gentlemen of the grand jury, waited on his
Excellency the Lieutenant Governor, when the Chief Justice, in his
robes of office, addressed his Excellency in the name of the whole,
as follows:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;We esteem it our indispensable duty to testify our zeal,
as Chief Justice, provost marshal, grand jurors, practitioners and
officers of H. M. Supreme Court of judicature, for the interest of
this province, and the protection of its laws, our attachment to your
person, and our respect and gratitude for your eminent services,
by expressing our joy in His Majesty appointing you to the chief
command of this his dominion of Nova Scotia. We shall ever
consider it as essential to our fidelity in the execution of the laws,
to exert our most vigilant endeavors for the ease and success of
your administrations, and not only to suppress any measures
subversive of your consultations for the public good, but at all
times affectuate the means prescribed by you for the prosperity of
the province. Our solicitude for the advancement of justice
under the laws, cannot be more fervently expressed, than by the
tender of our ardent wishes for your being and happy continuance
in the chief chair of this Government."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
To which his Excellency the Lieutenant Governor was pleased to
make the following answer:</p>

<p>"Mr. Chief Justice and gentlemen of the Supreme Court and
grand jury:</p>

<p>"I have the highest sense of this testimony of your zeal for the
public welfare and your esteem for me. I should be much
wanting in my duty if I did not embrace this opportunity of returning
my thanks for the late pious, learned and eloquent charge from
the Bench, and I doubt not, gentlemen, but your vigilance and
fidelity in the service of your country will have its desired effect.</p>

<p>"While I have the power to sit in the chair, be assured the
authority of Government shall be ready to support the law, for
the law, gentlemen, is the firm and solid basis of civil society, the
guardian of liberty, the protection of the innocent, the terror of
the guilty, and the scourge of the wicked.</p>

<p class="ralign smcap">"Charles Lawrence."</p>

<p>Governor Lawrence in his letter of 12th January, 1755, says, "I
am now preparing to build three batteries of 10 guns each in front
of the town, and contemplate finishing them in good time. These
batteries were erected along the line of the shore. The middle or
King's battery stood where the Queen's wharf now is, there was
another at the present Ordnance Yard, another near the site of
Fairbanks wharf, and a fourth at the present Lumber Yard, which
latter still remains."</p>

<p>The batteries along the front of the town were completed during
the summer of 1755, and a plan of them sent to England in June of
that year. They were twelve feet in height above high water mark,
two hundred and forty feet in length, and sixty-five in breadth.
The parapet raised on these was seven feet high, and the materials
consisted of logs and timber framed and filled up with gravel,
stones, earth and sand. The material consisted of 9500 logs of 25
feet, 1280 tons of square timber and 25,000 tons weight of gravel
and earth, the whole expense about £5,300. The work was commenced
in January, 1755, and completed late in the summer. 20
guns were mounted on these three batteries in July of that year&mdash;the
other batteries were afterwards added.</p>

<p>An attempt was made this year to involve the Government in a
dispute with the Indian tribes. Paul Laurant, an Indian Chief of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
Mic-Mac tribe, appeared before the Council on 12th February, 1755,
and informed them that he and another Indian Chief named
Algamud, had set out from Beausejour for Halifax in order to treat
of peace, but that the Chief had fallen sick at Cobequid and had
intrusted him with the proposals. They demanded the whole
eastern section of the Province, from Cobequid to Canso, to be set
apart for them as feeding and hunting grounds. Being asked what
security he could give that the Indians would keep the peace, he said
he could say nothing to that, being only desired to bring in the
terms. The Council dismissed him with a promise of an answer in
writing. An answer in writing was drawn up and signed by the
Governor on 13th February, 1755, which expressed a willingness on
the part of the Governor and Council to allow them such lands as
would be sufficient for their purposes. It mentioned the perfidious
breaches of all former treaties on the part of the Indians, and where
their conduct was complained of that the Tribes themselves had
disallowed all authority on the part of their Chiefs to make such
treaties, and that the Governor and Council demanded a full attendance
of Chiefs before them, with full power to treat, before any
further proceedings could be taken.</p>

<p>On the 3rd and 4th July, the Council was engaged with the
French Deputies, again on 14th, 15th and 28th same month.</p>

<p>The defence of the settlement was the next subject of deliberation
and the protection from the incursions of the French along the
Bay of Fundy and from Louisburg, both nations being at the time
arrayed against each other in open warfare.</p>

<p>On the 18th February, 1755, Mrs. Green, wife of Hon. Benj.
Green, and her family, Captain Horatio Gates and Mrs. Gates, with
Captain Hale and their servants and baggage, were received on
board Captain Rogers' sloop for Boston. Captain Gates had been
one of the Aides-de-Camp of Governor Cornwallis, he was afterwards
a General in the American Revolutionary Army.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The loss of the Mars, a 70 gun ship, occurred off the harbour in
May, 1755. It was in an easterly gale and supposed to be the fault
of the pilot. Guns and crew were all saved. The Mars rock at
the western entrance of the bay marks the spot. The guns and
stores were brought to Halifax. Admiral Holborn's letter announcing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
the loss of the ship bears date the 28th May, off Halifax
Harbour.</p>

<p>30th December, 1755, Montague Wilmot and Charles Morris,
having been appointed to the Council, were sworn in. The other
members were John Collier, Mr. Cotterell, Robert Monkton and
Captain Rous.</p>

<p>A number of French prizes, taken by the fleet under Admiral
Boscawen, were this summer brought into Halifax. There were in
these 19,998 gallons of rum and brandy.</p>

<p>A Mr. Ellis had for several years held the office of Governor of
Nova Scotia, and received the emoluments, but never came out. Lt.
Governor Lawrence received the appointment of Governor-in-Chief
on the resignation of Mr. Ellis, and Colonel Monkton became Lt.
Governor; their commissions were read and they sworn into office
on 23rd July, this year.</p>

<p>The following census of the town appears to have been taken
about 1755 or 1756:&mdash;</p>

<p>The only other event of this year worthy of notice was the
following melancholy affair detailed in Col. Sutherland's letter from
Lunenburg, dated 12th September. "Yesterday," he says, "I
received the melancholy account of Mr. Payzant's house being burned
in Mahone Bay, and that he himself and other people who were with
him, were killed by the Indians. I immediately sent out an officer
and party, which returned this morning, by whom I am informed
that on Payzant's Island the house is burned, he with another young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
man killed and scalped, a woman servant and child also killed and
scalped near the water side. His wife and four children missing.
The young man was son to a family which lived on Captain Rous's
Island. As his hands were tied the gentlemen immediately conjectured
some further mischief was done there, and on their arrival
they found the man thereto belonging, likewise scalped. It appears
that Captain Rous's is the most advanced settlement, that they
first came there and took the boy to conduct them to Payzant's."
Mr. Payzant came to this country with a strong recommendation
from Mr. Pownall, secretary to the Board of Trade. The death of
James Payzant, Esquire, a clerk in the office of the Secretary of
State, of the age of 100 years is announced in the London Gazette
for 1757. This was probably the father of the gentleman who came
out to Halifax, to whom Mr. Secretary Pownall's recommendation
referred.</p>

<p>1756. January 26th, the term of Henry Wynne and William
Manthorn's licences of the Dartmouth and Halifax ferry having
expired, John Rock petitioned and obtained the same on the terms
of his predecessors.</p>

<p>On the 30th June, 1757, Lord Loudon arrived at Halifax with
the troops from New York, destined for the invasion of Cape
Breton.</p>

<p>Saturday, 16th July, 1757, His Excellency acquainted the Council
that the Earl of Loudon had this day represented to him that a
fever had broken out among the troops, under His Lordship's
command, occasioned by the great quantities of rum that were sold to
the soldiers by unlicensed retailers, and if continued must prove of
fatal consequences to the service; and unless steps were immediately
taken to effectually stop the same, he would feel himself justified in
ordering all liquors found in the possession of such unlicensed
retailers to be destroyed. The Council empowered the Provost
Marshal and his deputies to enter such houses, seize the liquors and
place them in the King's store until the army and navy departed.</p>

<p>On the 1st November, 1757, the grand jury of the County of
Halifax petitioned the Governor and Council on behalf of the
inhabitants of the town, that the town should be put into some state
of defence "for the preservation of the place, the inhabitants, their
families and effects." They stated that the property, etc., was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
insecure from the want of proper defences; that the people were
willing to assist in the work, and intimated that if their prayer
could not be heard, humbly beg that they "may immediately know
it in order to take the first opportunity of convoying themselves,
their families and effects, to a place of safety in some of the neighbouring
Colonies." A previous petition had been presented to
the Governor, to which no answer had been returned. The names
attached to the petition were, Robert Saunderson, Joseph Rundell,
John Anderson, Paul Pritchard, Hugh McCoy, Joseph Fairbanks,
William Schwartz, Robert Campbell, William Pantree, John Killick,
John Brooks, Henry Wilkinson, Walter Manning, John Slayter,
Richard Catherwood, Joseph Pierce, Alexander Cunningham,
Richard Tritson, Jonathan Gifford and Benjamin Leigh.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the Township of Halifax were settled by order
in Council 20th May, 1758, as follows: That until said township
can be more particularly described, the limit thereof shall be deemed
to be as follows:</p>

<p>To comprehend all the lands lying southerly of a line extending
from the westernmost head of Bedford Basin, across the northerly
head of St. Margaret's Bay, with all the Islands near to said land,
together with the Islands called Cornwallis Island,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Webb's and
Rous' Island.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Minutes of Council 21st June, 1758: Mr. Josiah Marshall
proposed to build a workhouse, 50 feet long, 20 feet wide and 8
feet high, in the town. The timber to be laid close, with a roof
double boarded and shingled; to have 4 windows on each side, each
window to have nine panes of glass and three iron grates; to have a
staircase in the entry and a whipping post. The building to be
placed on a good dry wall. Mr. Marshall's tender for £200 sterling,
finding materials and labour, was accepted.</p>

<p>To Charles Morris, Joshua Mauger and Charles Proctor,
Esquires. "Whereas, it has been thought proper to convert to the
use of the public, a piece of land called Goreham's Point and the
lands next ajacent, lying in the north suburbs of Halifax,
formerly allotted to sundry persons, who have cleared and
improved the same and erected some buildings upon them; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
were directed to value the lands and proportion each owner's
extent therein, and report to His Excellency. Dec. 9th, 1758."</p>

<p>This is the site of the Commissioners' House in the present
Dockyard.</p>

<p>December 9th, 1758. Peter Marquis de Conte and Gravina,
convicted for intent to commit rape on a child under the age of ten
years, was sentenced by the Court to walk between the hours of 11
and 12 this day from the north to the south side of the Parade, and
from thence to the jail with a paper placed on his breast with his
crime inscribed thereon, and to be confined for three months and
fined thirty pounds; to remain in jail till the same be paid.
Governor Lawrence remitted the first part of this sentence. The
Marquis de Conte was a Sicilian nobleman; he had been an officer in
Goreham's Rangers.</p>

<p>December 29th, 1758. It appears by an advertisement of this
date, that Governor Lawrence had wells sunk and pumps erected as
reservoirs against fires, and that they had been damaged by some
unknown person. His Excellency caused them to be put in repair.</p>

<p>Governor Lawrence, in his letter to the Board of Trade, 3rd
November, 1759, mentions that the masonry of Sambro Light House
had been some time finished, and that the lantern was then in
progress of erection. That a chart of the harbour was also in
progress, as also proper directions for piloting in ships with safety.
Copies of these directions were enclosed in his letter.</p>

<p>It appears that in the year 1758, the Governor appropriated out
of the old crown duty money for the Light House £1,000, for the
Work House £500, for the Church £400, and for the Meeting
House £100.</p>

<p>Captain Rous was placed in charge of the Light House, a post
which he occupied for many years. This was not Captain John
Rous, the member of Council, but a relative of his from New
England.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
21st December, 1758. The Governor and Council appropriated
the sum of £400, raised by duties on liquors, towards the church in
Halifax, under the direction of Benjamin Green, John Collier,
Charles Morris, Robert Saunderson and Henry Newton, commissioners
for that purpose.</p>

<p class="center">[Extract of letter from Louisburg, June 9th.]</p>

<p>"Admiral Saunders, with the squadron under his command,
arrived in good condition on the 21st April off Louisburg, but on
account of ice blockading the harbour, was obliged to bear away
on the 26th for Halifax, whence he arrived on the first of May."</p>

<p>June 16th, 1759. Peter Marquis de Conte and Gravini, was
released from his imprisonment, he having paid his fine. This
gentleman died at Halifax. His will is recorded in the probate
office.</p>

<p>Thursday 16th August, 1759, William Cotteral, Robert Grant and
Montague Wilmot, Esquires, Councillors, being absent from the
Province, the Governor appointed Richard Bulkeley, Thomas Saul
and Joseph Gerrish, who were this day sworn in and took their
seats.</p>

<p>February, 1760, two Indian Chiefs attended the Council, and
were presented with laced blankets, laced hats, etc. They were
informed that the same would be sent to the Chief of the St. John's
Indians, and that the treaty of peace would be ready to be signed
to-morrow, and if the wind was favourable they should embark on
Sunday.</p>

<p>In Council 11th March, 1760, the Governor appointed the Hon.
Jonathan Belcher, Benjamin Green, John Collier, Charles Morris,
Richard Bulkeley, Thomas Saul and Joseph Gerrish, Esquires, and
William Nesbitt, John Duport, Joseph Scott, John Creighton,
Sebastian Zouberbuhler, Edward Crawley, Charles Proctor and
Benjamin Gerrish, Esquires, to be justices of the peace for the town
and county of Halifax. Charles Morris, John Duport, Joseph
Scott, Joseph Gerrish and Edward Crawley, Esquires, to be justices
of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas for the county of Halifax,
to the several of whom His Excellency then administered the oath
requisite.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the advantages held out by Government to the
settlers at Halifax, and the repeated large grants of money by
Parliament, the people were rapidly removing to the old Colonies.
Little progress had been made in clearing the country. The fishery,
one of the main inducements of the settlement, was almost altogether
neglected, and the population was reduced to much less than
half its original number. They subsisted chiefly on the money
expended by the Army and Navy, and were dependent on Boston
for their provisions and many other necessary supplies.</p>

<p>In 1755, Dr. Breynton, the minister at St. Paul's, estimated the
inhabitants of Halifax at 1,300, eight hundred of whom professed
themselves members of the Church of England; and again in 1763,
eight years later, according to the Doctor's returns to the Propagation
Society, the number was still found not to exceed one thousand
and three hundred souls; nine hundred and fifty of them being of
the Church of England, and three hundred and fifty Protestant
Dissenters and Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>Up to the year 1757, the enormous sum of £560,000 sterling had
been expended on the settlements, and though in some respects the
Colony had been considered a failure, yet in a military point of view
it was of incalculable importance to Great Britain, and to its
position as a naval and military depot may be ascribed in a great
measure the downfall of the French power in America.</p>

<p>On 30th June, 1757, Lord Loudon with his transports and 12,000
regulars and provincials arrived at Halifax, and on July following,
Admiral Holborn arrived with his fleet. This armament, which
was destined for an attack on Louisburg, left Halifax early in
August, but having proved a failure the fleet returned to England in
September, but Loudon returned with his army to New York; they
both left Halifax on the same day, 16th August. Holborn arrived
at Louisburg on 20th, where finding the French fleet superior to his
own, he continued to cruise off Louisburg harbour until 24th
September, when he encountered a severe gale of wind which
scattered his fleet, several ships were lost, eight sail got safe to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
Portsmouth, and the rest got to New York. This powerful
armament consisted of 13 sail of the line&mdash;the Newark 80 guns,
Invincible 74, Grafton 68, Terrible 74, Northumberland 68,
Captain 68, Bedford 64, Orford 68, Nassau 64, Sunderland 64,
Defiance 64, Tilbury 64, Kingston 60, Windsor 54, and the
Sutherland 50, with several others which afterwards joined them,
and 16 smaller vessels of war. The naval forces amounted 10,000
men, and the land forces to 12,000, six thousand of whom were
provincial troops. Loudon left three regiments at Halifax, and
several of the vessels remained to winter here.</p>

<p>In May of this year the Governor and Council offered a bounty
for sowing land with grass on the peninsula of Halifax, also for
the erection of stone fences around the lots, and for raising grain
and potatoes.</p>

<p>Loudon was succeeded in the supreme command by Abercrombie,
another incompetent&mdash;a debilitated old man who remained in command
for a short time. He was succeeded by Sir Jeffrey Amherst.</p>

<p>In the following spring about 12,000 troops arrived at Halifax,
under the command of General Amherst. They were soon followed
by Admiral Boscawen from England with a large fleet consisting of
23 ships of the line and 18 frigates. This great fleet arrived in
Halifax harbour in May, 1758, accompanied by 120 transports.
The land forces amounted to 12,260 men. On Sunday, 28th May,
they set sail from Halifax, 157 vessels in all. They were met by
General Amherst, with part of the force, as they went out of the
harbour. Governor Lawrence accompanied the army and took
command of one of the Brigades, Colonel Monkton being left in
command during his absence.</p>

<p>After the siege, which was protracted for two months, part of the
fleet and army returned to Halifax, and some of the vessels
remained to refit. The colony was sacked for provisions and the
town turned into a camp for the troops. A number of the
provincial soldiers and others, having enriched themselves with the
spoils at Louisburg, became settlers in the town. All the ammunition
and stores, with a quantity of private property, were removed
to Halifax, and the town once again began to assume a prosperous
appearance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
This year was also memorable as the one in which Representative
Government was established in Nova Scotia. The subject
of calling a Legislative Assembly had undergone much discussion.
It had been represented by the Governor and Council, to the
authorities in England, that such a step at that particular time
would be fraught with much danger to the peace of the colony.
Chief Justice Belcher, however, having given his opinion that the
Governor and Council possessed no authority to levy taxes, and
their opinion being confirmed in England, it was resolved in Council
on 3rd January, 1757, that a representative system should be
established and that twelve members should be elected by the
province at large, until it could be conveniently divided into
counties, and that the township of Halifax should send four
members, Lunenburg two, Dartmouth one, Lawrencetown one,
Annapolis Royal one, and Cumberland one, making in all twenty
two members, and the necessary regulations were also made for
carrying into effect the object intended.</p>

<p>Much discontent prevailed in the town, and also in other parts of
the province, in consequence of the opposition of Governor
Lawrence to the calling of a Representative Assembly. Hitherto
the Government had been carried on solely by the Governor and
Council, who possessed both Legislative and Executive authority.
Under the Royal instructions the Governor was directed to call a
Representative Assembly as soon as the circumstances of the
country would permit, but the Governor was of opinion that it
would be injudicious to proceed to a popular election until the
country was better prepared for it. After repeated remonstrances
from the people of Halifax and some pressure from his Council,
it was on the 7th January resolved in Council that an assembly
should be called, and a plan was drawn up and submitted to the
Board of Trade for the sanction of the home government. We find,
however, that in February following it was resolved by the inhabitants
of Halifax to petition the Crown against the conduct of
Governor Lawrence, not only as regards his unwillingness to
establish a representative government, but his oppressive and
overbearing conduct in other respects to many of the leading
inhabitants. This petition was entrusted to one Ferdinando Paris,
a gentleman in London, accompanied by affidavits and a power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
attorney, conferring on him authority to represent the subscribers
before the Privy Council and the Board of Trade and Plantations.
A subscription was set on foot, and about £120 sterling subscribed,
to meet the expenses of the application to Government. These
documents were certified by Chief Justice Belcher as authentic, on
14th March. As these proceedings bear date in February, 1757, it
is probable that the resolution of the Council of the 7th January
had not been made known. The petition and power were signed by
the following residents of the town who reputed themselves as a
committee appointed by the people for the purpose of forwarding
their views: Robert Saunderson, William Pantree, Malachi Salter,
Jonathan Binney, Otto Wm. Schwartz, Robert Campbell, Henry
Ferguson and John Grant. These papers were also accompanied by
a copy of an address from the people of Halifax to Lt. Governor
Robert Monkton, praying that certain sums of money, collected as
rum duties, etc., might be expended on the fortifications of the town
as a protection to the inhabitants, and offering to contribute both
labour and money for the purpose. It also complains of the
"miserable management of those who have had the direction of the
defences." This petition bears date 19th October, in the same
year. The language of one of the letters addressed to Mr. Paris,
the request on the subject of the Halifax grievances and the overbearing
military rule of Governor Lawrence, bespeak much
excitement to have existed in the town on the subject. The feeling
appears to have prevailed principally among the leading inhabitants.
We find that the list above referred to was signed by Mr. Binney,
Mr. Salter, Mr. Pantree, Mr. Schwartz, Dr. Grant, Mr. Saunderson,
Mr. Fairbanks, Mr. Robt. Campbell, Mr. Butler, Mr. Suckling,
Mr. Vanput, Mr. G. Gerrish, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Wiswell, Mr. Mason,
and many others.</p>

<p>On the first of November following, the Grand Jury of Halifax
petitioned Governor Lawrence that some immediate steps may be
taken to fortify the town so that the inhabitants might be placed in
a more secure position in case of invasion. They refer to a petition
presented to Lt. Governor Monkton on the same subject, to which
no reply had been made, and concluded by asking that they might
know without further delay what they were to expect; that if no
further security is to be provided for the settlement they may have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
an opportunity of conveying themselves, their families and effects to
a place of greater safety in some of the neighbouring Colonies.
The names of the Grand Jury were Robert Saunderson, Joseph
Rundell, John Anderson, Paul Pritchard, Hugh McKay, Joseph
Fairbanks, William Schwartz, Robert Campbell, William Pantree,
John Killick, John Brooks, Henry Wilkinson, Walter Manning,
John Slayter, Richard Catherwood, Joseph Pierce, Alexander
Cunningham, Richard Tritton, Jonathan Gifford and Benjamin
Leigh.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 2nd of October, 1758, the newly elected members
met in the Court House in Halifax, pursuant to summons from the
Provost Marshall; their names were as follows:</p>

<table class="left no-b" frame="void" rules="none" cellpadding="0" summary="">

</table>

<p>They sent Messrs. Nesbitt, Newton and Rundell, to wait on the
Governor, who sent Messrs. Morris and Green from the Council to
swear them in. They then chose Robert Saunderson their speaker,
which was confirmed by the Governor, who addressed them as
follows: "Gentlemen of the Council and House of Representatives:
His Majesty having been most graciously pleased by his
royal instructions to his Governors of this Province to direct the
calling an assembly of the freeholders to act in conjunction with his
Governor and Council as the Legislative Authority, when such a
measure should be found essential to his service; I am to assure
you that it is with particular pleasure I now meet you convened in
that capacity, in consequence of a plan some time since formed here
for that purpose, with the advice and assistance of His Majesty's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
Council, and by me transmitted to the Lord Commissioner for
Trade and Plantations to be laid before His Majesty for his
approbation.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:</p>

<p>"I entertain the most sanguine hopes that you are come together
unanimously disposed to promote the service of the Crown, or in
other words, the real welfare and prosperity of the people whom
you have the honour to represent, in every point to the utmost of
your authority and capacity.</p>

<p>"This, I presume, you will conceive is justly to be expected, not
only from the immediate regard due to the Civil Rights and
Interests of your constituents, but likewise from the unspeakable
obligations you are under to demonstrate in their behalf your
dutiful sense of His Majesty's paternal concern for the prosperity
and security of those his subjects in those distinguishing marks
of his royal favour and protection which we have from time to
time so happily experienced in the fleets and armies sent out for
our immediate preservation when we were under the most imminent
danger of being swallowed up by a merciless enemy; also in the
ample supplies of money for so many years annually granted for
the support and encouragement of this infant colony; and moreover
still, in the continuance of His Majesty's royal bounty for
that purpose, when from the seeming inclination of the inhabitants
to have an assembly convened some time ago, it might have
been presumed, and indeed by an article of His Majesty's
Instructions, which I shall order to be laid before you, it has been
judged that the Colony has become capable of providing for the
necessary support of government here, as has been usual in all
His Majesty's other American Dominions.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of both Houses:</p>

<p>"As my Military occupation requires my attendance as early as
possible upon the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces to the Westward,
and as the Lieutenant Governor is now necessarily employed,
and will be for some time to come, upon an enterprise of
importance in a distant part of the province, there is not at
present an opportunity of entering upon such particulars as might
otherwise call for your attention; I am therefore earnestly to
recommend to your serious consideration the expediency, or rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
the necessity of unanimity and dispatch in the confirmation of
such Acts or resolutions of a legislative nature, as the Governor
and Council under His Majesty's Royal Instructions have found
expedient, before the forming of an assembly and indispensably
necessary for promoting the welfare and peaceable Government of
this people.</p>

<p>"You may depend upon it, Gentlemen, on my return to the
Government you will find me perfectly disposed to concur with
you in enacting such further laws, making such amendments to
the present ones, and establishing such other regulations as shall
appear upon more mature deliberations to be consistent with the
honour and dignity of the Crown and conducive to the lasting
happiness of His Majesty's subjects where I have the honour to
preside.</p>

<p class="ralign smcap">Charles Lawrence."</p>

<p>The House then resolved that the members should all serve without
pay for the session. The calling of the Legislature had been
delayed till the autumn in consequence of both the Governor and
Lt. Governor being absent with the Army at Louisburg. Governor
Lawrence came up to Halifax from Louisburg specially to meet the
Legislature.</p>

<p>The Governor in his letter to the Board of Trade about this time
noticed particularly the serious effects on the settlement of the
enormous importation and retail of spirituous liquors, and expressed
a hope that the Legislature would check it.</p>

<p>On 2nd July, 1761 (second session) the House voted £50 for a
public clock in the Town.</p>

<p>The following year (1759) Halifax was again the rendezvous for
part of the fleet and army both before and after the siege of Quebec;
not a few of the more enterprising settlers followed the camp and
enriched themselves during the war, Admiral Darell with 4 ships
of the line arrived in Halifax Harbor in April and left for the St.
Lawrence on 5th May.</p>

<p>At the news of the victory, the town was illuminated, and fire
works, bonfires and other public entertainments lasted several days.</p>

<p>Between the years 1759 and 1763 the harbor had been the
constant resort of the squadrons under Lord Colville and others;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
the place was enlivened by the presence of a large army and navy,
and at the close of the war several gentlemen of condition were
induced to become settlers.</p>

<p>Peace having been proclaimed in 1763, the 28th day of December
of that year was solemnized at Halifax as a day of thanksgiving on
account of the termination of the war. Though the town possessed
all the advantages to be derived from the presence of the naval and
military forces, the resident population did not increase. From the
notitia parochialis of the Rev. Dr. Breynton, the Rector of St. Paul's,
the number of inhabitants in the town did not exceed 1300 souls.
However, in 1769, six years after, the Doctor makes the following
return: Inhabitants in and about Halifax including Garrison,
Acadian French and fishermen, by the late public survey 5000 souls,
of which 200 are Acadians and 55 protestant dissenters. The number
of births that year was 200 and the deaths 190.</p>

<p>Among the local occurrences of the year 1759, was the trial of
Thomas Lathum, baker, for the murder of Lieutenant Collins of the
Royal Navy. It appeared that Mr. Collins, Captain Sweeney,
Doctor Johns, Mr. Fulton and others of the Navy, had been sipping
at the house of one John Field, and late in the evening proposed to
go out in search of some women with whom one of them had made
an engagement. They knocked at the door of one Hewitt, and
inquired for Polly. On being refused admission, it appeared that
Thomas Lathum, the brother-in-law of Hewitt, who lived in the
neighbourhood, hearing the noise, came to his own door and
demanded of the gentlemen in the street whether they intended to
rob Mr. Hewitt. They replied that they were gentlemen and not
robbers. Some further words provoked a scuffle, in which Fulton
was dragged by Lathum into his house. The affair terminated in
Lathum discharging a gun after the party, and mortally wounding
Collins. Captain Sweeny had previously called the guard, who
shortly after the affair arrived and took Lathum into custody.
Lathum was tried on the 24th April, 1759.</p>

<p>The names of the grand jury, who found the bill of indictment,
were Michael Francklin, foreman, Charles Proctor, Abraham
Bowyer, Walter Manning, James Quinn, Nathan Nathans, J.
Pernette, John Craig, Terrence Fitzpatrick, John Kerby, Jonathan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
Pierce, James Porter, Henry Sibley, J. Flanagan, Michael Moloney,
Robert Cowie, Charles Terlaven, Jonathan Gifford and James
Browne.</p>

<p>On the 11th March, 1760, the following gentlemen were appointed
Justices of the Peace for the county of Halifax, viz.: The Hon.
Jonathan Belcher, Hon. Benjamin Green, Hon. John Collier, Hon.
Charles Morris, Hon. Richard Bulkeley, Hon. Thomas Saul, Hon.
Joseph Gerrish, William Nesbitt, John Duport, Joseph Scott, John
Creighton, Sebastine Zouberbuhler, Edward Crawley, Charles
Proctor and Benjamin Gerrish, and on 30th December following,
Malachi Salter, Alexander Grant, Johnathan Binney and John
Burbidge were added to the number. Messrs. Morris, Duport,
Scott, Gerrish and Crawley were appointed Justices of the Inferior
Court of Common Pleas.</p>

<p>Governor Lawrence, who had been for 7 days ill, died of inflammation
of the lungs on the morning of the 19th October, 1760. The
Council were immediately summoned, and Chief Justice Belcher
sworn in to administer the Government. A question had arisen on
a previous occasion, between Mr. Belcher and Mr. Green, as to the
eligibility of the Chief Justice to the office of administrator of the
Government, which was decided in favour of the Chief Justice, but
some years after, the question was determined by the British
Government declaring that the two offices of administrator of the
Government and Chief Justice, should never be held by the same
person.</p>

<p>It was resolved in Council, that the funeral of the late Governor
should be at the public expense, and a monument to his memory
was afterwards voted by the Assembly to be placed in St. Paul's
Church.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The funeral of Governor Lawrence took place on the Thursday
following, 24th October, at 4 p. m. The procession began from
Government House as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Troops in Garrison, the Military Officers, two field pieces 6
pounders, the Physicians, the ministers, the corpse in a coffin
covered with black velvet, and the pall, to which were affixed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
escutcheons of His Excellency's arms, supported by the President
and the rest of His Majesty's Council.</p>

<p>The Mourners, the Provost Marshall, the House of Assembly, the
Magistrates, the Civil Officers, the Freemasons and a number of the
inhabitants. The Bearers, Clergy, Physicians and all Officers, Civil
and Military had linen and cambric hat-bands.</p>

<p>The corpse was preceded near the church by the orphans singing
an anthem. The pulpit, reading desk and the Governor's pew, were
covered with black and escutcheons, and a most pathetic Funeral
Sermon was preached by the Reverend Mr. Breynton, Rector of the
Parish, after which the corpse was interred on the right side of the
Communion Table.</p>

<p>Minute guns were fired from one of the batteries, from the time
the procession began, until the interment, when the whole was
concluded with three volleys from the troops under arms.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court, which began on Tuesday following, was
hung in mourning and escutcheons.</p>

<p>The following fulsome eulogium, to the late lamented Governor,
appeared in the newspapers of the day: "The Lieutenant Governor
was possessed of every natural endowment and acquired, accomplishment
necessary to adorn the most exalted station, and every
amiable quality that could promote the sweets of friendship and
social intercourse of human life.</p>

<p>"As Governor, he exerted his uncommon abilities with unwearied
application, and the most disinterested zeal in projecting and
executing every useful design that might render this Province and
its rising settlements flourishing and happy. He encouraged the
industrious, rewarded the deserving, excited the indolent, protected
the oppressed and relieved the needy. His affability and masterly
address endeared him to all ranks of people, and a peculiar greatness
of soul made him superior to vanity, envy, avarice or
revenge.</p>

<p>"In him we have lost the guide and guardian of our interests,
the reflection on the good he has done, the anticipation of great
things still expected from such merits, and circumstances which,
while they redound to his honour, aggravate the sense of our
irreparable misfortune."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
About the end of October, Commodore Lord Colville arrived in
the harbor with the Northumberland and three other ships of the
line and several frigates from Quebec. The Sloop-of-War England
also arrived from England with dispatches and next day sailed for
Louisburg and Quebec. Several transports also came in about the
same time with Col. Montgomery's Highlanders to relieve the two
battalions of the 60th Royal Americans.</p>

<p>Among the advertisements in the Halifax Gazette of 1st November,
1760, is the following:</p>

<p>"To be sold at public auction, on Monday the 3rd of November,
at the house of Mr. John Rider, two Slaves, viz.: a boy and girl,
about eleven years old; likewise, a puncheon of choice old cherry
brandy, with sundry other articles."</p>

<p>1759. Among the town officers nominated by the Grand Jury
this year were, John Fillis, Richd. Wenman, Richd. Gibbon and
Wm. Schwartz as Commissioners of the poor for the town.</p>

<p>Surveyors of Highways, Chas. Morris, Esq., Chas. Proctor, Esq.,
Mr. Wm. Prescott and Mr. John Rider.</p>

<p>This year an Act of the Legislature was passed to regulate the
Sambro Light House at the entrance of Halifax Harbor, which had
been erected the previous year at the expense of £1000. The Work
House was also erected this year. Firing guns within the town
and peninsula was forbidden in 1758 under a penalty.</p>

<p>The accession of King George the Third was proclaimed at
Halifax on the 11th February, 1761, with great ceremony. The
proclamation was first read at the Court House door,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> then at the
north gate of the town,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> at Government House, at the south gate,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
and lastly on the Parade, where the troops were drawn up and a
salute fired by the artillery. Lord Colville's fleet being in the
harbour at the time, "each ship fired a Royal Salute, beginning
with his Lordship's flagship the Northumberland."</p>

<p>The order of the procession on this occasion was as follows:&mdash;1st,
A Company of Grenadiers; 2nd, Constables of the Town; 3rd,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
Magistrates; 4th, Civil Officers of Government; 5th, Constables;
6th, The Provost Marshall with two deputies on horseback; 7th, a
Band of Music; 8th, Constables; 9th, The Commander-in-Chief of
the Province, the Honorable Jonathan Belcher, with Admiral Lord
Colville and Colonel Foster, commandant of the Garrison, and the
members of His Majesty's Council; 10th, the Speaker and the
members of the House of Assembly, followed by the principal
inhabitants. At three o'clock the company waited on the Commander-in-Chief
at Governor Lawrence's head tavern, where a very
elegant entertainment was provided for them, and after dinner His
Majesty's health was drunk under Royal Salute from the Batteries,
also other toasts, and the evening concluded with great rejoicings
and illuminations, bon-fires and artificial fire works, played off by
the Royal Artillery. A sermon was afterwards ordered to be
preached (13th February, 1761) in St. Paul's Church, on account of
the decease of the late King, and all public amusements were
ordered to cease for one month from that day. The 17th was
accordingly set apart and the sermon preached by the Rev. T.
Wood, the Curate. Part of St. Paul's church was hung in black,
and minute guns were fired for an hour and a half, and the flags on
the Citadel and George's Island were half-mast during the day.</p>

<p>On the 11th day of February, 1760, two Indian Chiefs of the
Passamaquoddy and St. John River tribes, came to Halifax with
Colonel Arbuthnot and appeared before the Council, and by their
interpreter, settled with the Governor terms of peace, renewing the
Treaty of 1725 and giving hostages for their good behaviour. At
their request truck houses were established at Fort Frederick.
Benjamin Gerrish, John Collier and Thomas Saul were appointed a
Committee to prepare the Treaty in French and English, which was
to be taken back with them to be ratified by their tribes. It was
arranged that Colonel Arbuthnot should accompany them, and that
they should be sent back at the public expense, after which His
Majesty's health was drunk and the Chiefs returned to the quarters
assigned them by the Governor. On the 13th the Treaty was
ratified in Council and the Indians and the Governor and Council
settled the table of the prices to be established at the truck houses.
The Indians stated that the number of their tribes, men, women and
children, was about 500. During the sitting of the Council on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
13th, Roger Morris, one of the Mic-Mac Indians, appeared and
brought with him three Frenchmen who were lately arrived from
Pictou, and another Indian called Claude Renie, who said he was
Chief of the Tribe of Cheboudie Indians. He stated that he had left
70 of his people at Jeddore; the men were out killing moose and
their families were in want of provisions. It was arranged that
provisions should be sent to them and that the men should forthwith
come up and conclude a peace.</p>

<p>Treaties of peace were afterwards concluded on 10th March
following with three Mic-Mac Chiefs, viz., Paul Laurent, chief of
the Tribe of LaHave, Michael Augustine, chief of the Tribe of
Richibucto, and the before-mentioned Claude Renie, chief of the
Cheboudie and Musquodoboit Indians; the treaty was signed in
Council on that day and they received their annual presents. Another
treaty of peace was signed in Council on 15th October, 1761, with
Jannesvil Peitougawash, Chief of the Indians of the Tribe of
Pictock and Malogomish, and the merchants and traders were
notified that the Indian trade to the eastward would be thrown open
under regulations in the following spring. The following summer
Joseph Argunault, Chief of the Mongwash Indians, with a number
of followers, appeared before the Council and executed a final
Treaty of peace. The members of Council and Legislature, with
the Magistrates and public officers, attended on the occasion.</p>

<p>The Abbe Mallaird being introduced, interpreted the treaty to the
Chief, who was then addressed by the Hon. Mr. Belcher, the Commander-in-Chief.
The treaty was respectively signed by the
Commander-in-Chief and the Indian Chief, and witnessed by the
members of the Council present, the Speaker of the Assembly and
Mr. Mallaird.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The Chief then addressed Mr. Belcher in the
following manner: That he had formerly paid obedience to another
King, but that he now acknowledged King George 3rd for his only
lawful Sovereign, and vowed eternal fidelity and submission to him;
that his submission was not by compulsion, but that it was free and
voluntary with his whole heart, and that he should always esteem
King George 3rd as his good father and protector. That he now
buried the hatchet in behalf of himself and his whole tribe, in token<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
of their submission, and of their having made a peace which should
never be broken upon any consideration whatever. The Chief then
laid the hatchet on the earth, and the same being buried the Indians
went through the ceremony of washing the paint from their bodies,
in token of hostilities being ended, and then partook of a repast set
out for them on the ground, and the whole ceremony was concluded
by all present drinking the King's health and their Haggas. This
ceremony is said to have been performed in the Governor's garden,
westward of the old English burial ground, where the Court House
now stands. Benjamin Gerrish, Esquire, was appointed Commissioner
of Indian Affairs, and additional truck houses were built and
other arrangements made throughout the Province for more
effectually carrying on the Indian trade.</p>

<p>On the 30th December, 1760, Malachi Salter, Alexander Grant,
Jonathan Binney and John Burbidge were appointed Justices of the
Peace for the Town of Halifax. Mr. Burbidge was a member of
Assembly; he afterwards removed to the country and settled in
Cornwallis township, where his descendants now remain.</p>

<p>The French having invaded the British settlements in Newfoundland,
and captured the fort of St. John, a council-of-war was called
at Halifax, for the purpose of consulting on means of the defence
of the town in case of an attack. This Council was composed of
Lt. Governor Belcher, Col. Richard Bulkely, Halifax Militia, Major
General Bastead of the Engineers, Col. William Foster, Lt. Col.
Hamilton, Lt. Col. Job Winslow, and the Right Honorable Lord
Colville, commander-in-chief of the squadron. They met on the
10th July, 1762, and continued their sittings until 17th August.
They recommended to Government the embodying a portion of the
militia force, and that the Batteries on George's Island, Fort George,
Point Pleasant and East Battery should be put in repair and guns
mounted, and the erection of such works around the town and at the
Dockyard as might be considered necessary for the protection of the
place. The whole to be placed under the superintendence of
General Bastead of the Engineers. Some of the old works were
put in repair and others added on this occasion, but the cause of
alarm having subsided, further expense was deemed unnecessary.</p>

<p>At the first settlement it had been found necessary to occupy not
only every elevated position in the vicinity, but also large spaces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
around the town as at first laid out, for the purposes of defence and
other military objects. After the necessity for those defences had
ceased, it frequently occurred that the military commanders would
lay claim to the grounds as military property, and in this way
obstacles had continually arisen to the extension of the town, a
grievance which has continued to be felt until the present time.
Those whose duty it was to plan and lay out the town appear to
have been guided more with a view to the construction of a military
encampment than that of a town for the accommodation of an
increasing population. The narrow blocks and small dimensions of
the building lots have been found to be a continual drawback on the
comfort, the health and the convenience of the inhabitants, and of
late years these inconveniences have been severely felt in the business
parts of the city. This, however, was not the case in laying out
the north and south suburbs; here the lots were of ample dimensions,
and though the streets were not of the width frequently met with in
modern cities, yet of sufficient dimensions to ensure comfort. It is
to be regretted that the town and city authorities, during the last 35
years, have not, as in other places, exerted their authority in the
arrangement and laying off of building lots, and by wholesome
regulations, prevented the crowding of buildings on pieces of land
not sufficiently deep to admit of proper ventilation. It is also a
matter of the utmost importance to the future welfare of the city
that those lands now in the hands of the military and naval boards
in various directions around the city which are not immediately
required for military works should be handed over to the Civil
Government for public promenades and other useful purposes.</p>

<p>July 18th, 1768. The Chiefs of the tribes of Indians of St.
John's River, named Pierre Thomas and Ambroise St. Aubon,
appeared before the Council with the following requests: They
said the use of rum and spirituous liquors was too common among
them, and requested that a remedy might be thought of to prevent
it. They also required lands for cultivation, and that they should
not be required to bear arms in case of war with any of the
European powers. That some further regulations of prices in their
traffic should be made, and several other matters, all of which
appear to have been granted them. They desired to return home as
soon as possible, that their people might not be debauched with
liquor in the town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
This year (1768) Mr. Joshua Mauger retired from the office of
Agent of the Province in London. Mr. Mauger came up from
Louisburg with the army and resided in the town as a distiller of
rum, and followed the camp for several years. He received grants
of land from the government in various parts of the province. The
bench at the south-west extremity of Cornwallis Island, now known
as McNab's Island, was named after him. Mr. Mauger was
afterwards elected a member of the British Parliament.</p>

<p>In the month of May of this year was presented to the Legislature
the celebrated revolutionary document known as the Massachusetts
or Boston Letter. This was a letter addressed by Speaker Cushin
of the House of Representatives at Boston, to the Speaker of the
Assembly in Nova Scotia. It bears the date February 11, 1768, and
was on the subject of the differences existing between the British
Government and the American Colonies, then on the eve of revolt.
This letter is couched in very moderate but firm language; it
appears to have been received, however, with great indignation by
the House, who declined to have it read. A memorial was presented
to the Governor and Council in March, 1767, by Colonel Dalrymple,
then commander of His Majesty's troops at Halifax, complaining of
the undue occupation of grounds about the town, on which there had
been palisaded forts and lines of defence. It appeared that
Governor Lawrence had granted certain small tracts of land on
which a palisaded line of defence had formerly been, and that such
tracts of land could not be supposed to come into use on any future
occasion for fortifications. That Colonel McKellan of the Engineers
had advised the situation of the Work House with an enclosure, in
the front of said line, and that a whole bastion of two curtains of
Lutterell's fort were covered by it, and that Governor Lawrence had
further laid out more of such grounds on which part of the
palisading of Horseman's Fort formerly stood, all of which it
appeared he did by an undoubted right of the power given him by
the King's Commission, to erect and demolish fortifications, and
therefore to convert the ground to other uses, it being no more
serviceable for the former purposes. But it also appeared that none
of the Barracks were ever granted or admitted into private occupation.
That Governor Lawrence had admitted the occupation of some of
the ground reserved for fortification, on condition it should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
surrendered when the King's service should again require it, by
which it was evident that the King's rights in their lands had been
sufficiently secured. Horseman's fort occupied the ground in the
vicinity of the present Roman Catholic Cathedral. Lutterell's
fort stood where the old Poor House and County Jail formerly
stood. In June, 1763, the Council recommended the Governor to
make a grant of the Common for the Town of Halifax to trustees
for the benefit of the inhabitants. The Trustees were John Collier,
Charles Morris, Richard Bulkeley, William Nesbitt, Charles Proctor
and Richard Best. Some question having arisen as to the limits of
the common, the Council were unanimously of the opinion that the
lands which had been granted without the town were not within the
limits of the Common as appeared by the plan thereof laid before
the Lords of Trade, and which had not been disapproved of by their
Lordships. No copy of this plan is now to be found.</p>

<p>The number of families residing in and around the town in 1763
was estimated at 500, which would make the population about 2500
souls. There was also supposed to be, at this time, about one
thousand Acadian French in and about the town.</p>

<p>In June, 1763, the Hon. Montague Wilmot was sworn in Lieut.
Governor in place of Mr. Belcher. In the following year he
received the appointment of Governor-in-Chief.</p>

<p>On the 29th day of September, 1766, the Germans, who had been
located to the west of the peninsula, the settlement now known as
the Dutch Village, petitioned the Government that a convenient
road should be laid out for them to their settlement. The Surveyor
was ordered to report on the petition. He reported that he found
the road from the north German lots to the southward of George
Bayers' stone wall, now laid out, in the most convenient place, and
that the road should be at least four rods wide. That from George
Bayers' stone wall the road should be on the south side of said wall
and thence to run until it meets the public road leading to the town.</p>

<p>About this time, at the request of the Magistrates, the Hospital
was granted for an alms house. This hospital was established very
early for the use of the settlers, and stood on part of the land now
occupied by the Government House, to the north of that building.</p>

<p>The church of St. Paul's had now been for some years finished,
and the Town and vicinity had been, by an Act of Legislature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
constituted into a parish with corporate powers in the church
wardens and vestry. After the death of Mr. Tutty, the Reverend
Thomas Wood, from the Province of New Jersey, was appointed to
assist Dr. Breynton, and he and the doctor were jointly inducted
into the parish in 1758; Dr. Breynton as rector, and Mr. Wood as
vicar or curate, to assist. Mr. W. continued at St. Paul's until 1763,
when he was removed to Annapolis Royal with the consent of the
Governor and the church wardens and vestry, when the whole duties
of the Mission at Halifax devolved upon Mr. Breynton. Mr. B. was
in the habit of officiating to the Germans in their own language.
In 1761, he preached in German and English to the small congregation
in the old Dutch church in Brunswick Street, on occasion of its
being dedicated as the church of St. George. In 1770, at the
solicitation of the Governor and Council, the Chief Justice and the
congregation of St. Paul's, he received from the University of
Cambridge the degree of D. D., to which he was entitled from his
standing in the University. Early in his ministry the Doctor
established in the Town an orphan school, and provided for the
tuition of 50 poor children, through the assistance afforded him by
the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Mr. Ralph
Sharrock, a discharged soldier, was his first schoolmaster. In
1776, Dr. Breynton mentions in his report to the Society, having
administered the Lord's Supper to 500 men of the Baron de Seiltz's
German regiment in their own language "whose exemplary and
regular behaviour" he says, "did them great honour." The
following extract from a document, in reference to Dr. Breynton,
said to have been written by a Dissenter, is given by Mr. Hawkins,
from the records of the Propagation Society: "As a person who,
during a residence of upwards of twenty years in this Province, has
deservedly gained the good will and esteem of men of all ranks and
persuasions. He preaches the Gospel of peace and purity, with an
eloquence of language and delivery, far beyond anything I ever
heard in America." He lived to a good old age, preserving the
esteem of his fellow townsmen to the last. He appears to have
lived on terms of Christian fellowship with the clergy of other
denominations, as we find that at the annual meeting of the Church
Society, which took place in St. Paul's in 1770, the dissenting
ministers all attended at the Church to hear the doctor preach his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
Visitation Sermon. One of the last acts of his ministry was the
establishment of a Sunday School in the city. This was about
1783, perhaps a little later, and was the first Sunday School
instituted in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>In the month of July, 1769, a large number of Indians, many
of whom at this time appear to have been Protestants, attended
divine service in St. Paul's Church, when prayers were read by the
Reverend Thomas Wood, in the Mic-Mac language, the Governor
and many of the principal inhabitants being present. The Indians
sang an anthem both before and after the service. Before the
service began a Chief came forward, and kneeling down, prayed for
the prosperity of the Province and the blessing of Almighty God on
King George, the Royal family and the Governor of the Province.
He then rose up, and Mr. Wood, who understood the language, at
his desire explained the prayer in English to the whole congregation.
When service was ended the Indians returned thanksgivings
for the opportunity they had of hearing prayers in their own
language. In the following year Mr. Wood again performed divine
service at Halifax in the Mic-Mac language at the residence of
Colonel Joseph Gorham, where a number of Indians were
assembled. He had obtained great influence with the Indians
through his friendship with the Abbe Maillard, and particularly
from his behaviour to him a little before his death. He was in
consequence frequently called on both by the Indians and French to
baptize their children and visit the sick in the absence of a priest of
their own church. In one of his letters to the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel, in 1762, he mentions having attended
the Abbe Maillard during his illness of several weeks, and at his
request, the day before his death read to him the office of visitation
of the sick in presence of many of the French, and having performed
the funeral service of the Church of England, in French, on
his remains in the presence of the principal inhabitants of Halifax
and a number of French and Indians. The Governor and all the
public functionaries attended the funeral of M. Maillard, who was
highly esteemed and beloved in the community, and the members of
His Majesty's Council were the pall bearers.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
Mr. Wood was shortly after removed to Annapolis Royal, where
he died in the year 1778. While there he applied himself to a
closer study of the Mic-Mac language, and by assistance of papers
left him by M. Maillard was enabled to prepare a Mic-Mac
grammar and dictionary. He sent the first volume of his grammar,
and a Mic-Mac translation of the Creed and Lord's Prayer to
England in 1776. He continued occasionally to minister to the
Indians in their own language until his death.</p>

<p>February 26th, 1769. Halifax harbour was so full of ice that
vessels could not come in, which had not been the case for (says the
Gazette for that day) ten years. The cold was intense, snow
between four and five feet deep in the woods and on the peninsula,
an instance of which had not been known for several years.</p>

<p>May 9th, 1769. Major Leonard Lockman died after a lingering
illness in the 73rd year of his age; he was interred under the old
German church in Brunswick Street, and a monument to his
memory, with coat of arms, is yet to be seen in that church. Major
Lockman was one of the leading settlers among the Germans. The
street running between the German lots and Water Street in the
north suburbs bears his name.</p>

<p>In the fall of this year the town was visited by a severe gale of
wind from the S. W., which caused the destruction of much
property and some loss of life.</p>

<p>Among the principal merchants in Halifax in 1769, the Hon.
John Butler, uncle to the late Hon. J. Butler Dight, Robert
Campbell on the Beach, John Grant, Alexander Brymer, Gerrish
and Gray appear most prominent. Among the shopkeepers and
tradesmen who advertized during the year were, Robert Fletcher on
the Parade, Bookseller and Stationer, Andrew Cunod, Grocer,
Hammond and Brown, Auctioneers, Robert Millwood, Blockmaker,
who advertized best Spanish River Coal at 30s. per chaldron.</p>

<p>The period between 1770 and 1776 was one of great public
excitement, emissaries from the revolted colonies were numerous,
and the Governor and Council deemed it expedient as early as
1770, to prohibit all public meetings of a political nature.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
same spring the general election took place, after which the House
sat for fourteen years without being dissolved.</p>

<p>In 1771, Governor Lord William Campbell issued a proclamation
forbidding horse races as tending to gambling and idleness.</p>

<p>October 8th, 1773. Governor Legge was sworn into office.</p>

<p>The subject of fortifying the town came under the consideration
of the Council in the following year. It was considered that the
ground being rocky in many places around the town, it would not
admit of entrenchments being made, and that the only practical
fortifications would be temporary blockhouses and palisades, and it
was resolved that the Engineers under Col. Spry do immediately
proceed to fortify the Navy Yard in that manner, which may be
defended by the people of the town, and afford a retreat for them.
Any attempt at fortifying the Citadel Hill this season was thought
to be out of the question, the season being too late, the scarcity of
workmen very great, and there being no troops for its defence.</p>

<p>The Governor proposed and it was agreed in Council to collect a
force of 1000 men with pay and provisions, and that four companies
of light infantry now forming at Lunenburg be ordered up,
and that 100 Acadians from Clare and Yarmouth, and two light
companies from Kings County do march immediately to Halifax.
The public authorities appear to have been kept in a constant state
of apprehension of invasion, while a continued suspicion of many of
the leading inhabitants being favourable to the revolt, seemed to
have taken possession of the mind of Governor Legge, who, having
differences of opinion with some of his officials, attributed their
disagreement with him on subjects of finance, etc., as marks of
disloyalty. He at length became so obnoxious to those in
authority, that it was deemed advisable to remove him from the
Government. His quarrels with Jonathan Binney, Governor
Francklin and other leading men of the town, are disclosed in the
official letters and minutes of Council of that day.</p>

<p>It was found necessary to remove the Military Stores to George's
Island for safety, and additional batteries were erected there. The
officers of the Town Regiment of Militia were called on to subscribe
the Oath of Allegiance before going on duty. Those who subscribed
were Col. Butler, Major Smith, Captains Vanput, Brown,
Finney and Millet, Lieutenants Pyke, Piers, Solomon, Clarke and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
Fletcher, Second Lieutenants Tritton, Jacobs, Schwartz and Kerby,
and Adjutant Peters. Among them we recognize several family
names, the grandsires of some of our present citizens.</p>

<p>Among the magistrates appointed in 1771 were Joseph Gray,
John Amiel and Captain Thompson of His Majesty's Ship Mermaid.</p>

<p>The bureau of Governor Legge, at the Government House, was
broken open in 1744, and a reward of £100 was offered for the
detection of the thief.</p>

<p>The condition of the Orphan House, and the children therein,
was considered bad, and an order was issued for immediate steps to
be taken for its being put on a better footing.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1774, Sambro Light House was without
light for five successive nights in consequence of Mr. Woodmass,
the contractor, not having sent down a supply of oil, for which he
was dismissed by Order of Council.</p>

<p>The following year William Nesbitt, speaker of the House of
Assembly, was appointed Custos of Halifax County, and the names
of Thomas Bridge and Thomas Proctor added to the Commission of
the Peace.</p>

<p>Col. Butler, commanding the militia force, reported that the
sickness in the town, together with the daily labour of the inhabitants,
rendered it difficult to make up the number of men ordered for the
town guard, which duty the people considered a hardship. The
guard was accordingly ordered by the Council to be discontinued.</p>

<p>The scarcity of provisions in the town was at this time so great
that the government found it necessary to dispatch the Snow
Elizabeth to Quebec for flour for the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The impressment of men for the Navy had been a great grievance;
the trade of the country was not only injured, but the town was
becoming deprived of fish and fuel in consequence of the scarcity of
fishermen and labourers. The merchants petitioned the Governor
and Council on the subject. The memorial was sent to the naval
commander of the station; it does not appear, however, that any
further attention was paid to the remonstrance.</p>

<p>In September, 1775, it was proposed to throw up some temporary
works in addition to the old works on Citadel Hill, and to entrench
about the naval yard. On consideration, it was thought too late in
this season to do any earth work on Citadel Hill. Col. Spry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
however, proposed the erection of Blockhouses in the neighbourhood
of the town. It is probable the old Blockhouses at Fort Needham
and Three Mile House, the remains of which are within the
recollection of many of our citizens, may have been originally
constructed about this time. They were in full repair during the
war of 1812.</p>

<p>A continual influx of strangers from the old colonies caused
Martial Law to be proclaimed on the 30th of November of this year,
and it was deemed necessary by the Council that a proclamation
should be issued requiring all persons not being settled inhabitants
of the town, who had arrived since September, to give notice of their
arrival and names to two Magistrates, and all inn and tavern
keepers were required to report arrivals at their houses, and vessels
were forbidden entering the North West Arm without license. One
thousand militiamen were ordered for the defence of the town. The
constant arrival of loyalist refugees from the revolted colonies,
during this and subsequent years, rendered provisions scarce,
and in addition to these troubles, the small-pox broke out in the
town about the middle of July. The King's troops had all been
removed from Nova Scotia to the revolted provinces, and the
Governor was informed by the home authorities that no troops
could be spared, and that the inhabitants themselves must defend the
town. The town guard was accordingly again composed of militia.</p>

<p>1775. The fifth General Assembly held this year its seventh
session from 12th June to 20th July. Mr. Nesbitt was Speaker.
Chief Justice Belcher presided at the quarter sessions this summer,
and gave a very loyal address to the Magistrates and public
functionaries present; all Magistrates and town officers took the
Oath of Allegiance. The general feeling throughout the town
appeared to have been eminently loyal; some of the leading citizens,
however, though firm in their allegiance to the British Crown, yet
thought that self government in the Colonies in fiscal matters was
the correct policy. This threw several under suspicion; Mr. John
Fillis, Mr. Malachi Salter and Mr. Smith, who were natives of
Boston, were among the number.</p>

<p>Mr. Legge, the Governor, proposed to raise a regiment in Halifax,
to be commanded by himself, but was unsuccessful owing to his
unpopularity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
In the autumn of the previous year, a difficulty had arisen
regarding the importation of some tea, in which Mr. Smith and Mr.
Fillis were concerned; and it having been understood that Fillis had
said the measures of Government were oppressive, these two
gentlemen were ordered to be removed from all offices under
Government. The year previous a quantity of hay belonging to
Joseph Fairbanks, intended for the King's service, had been
burned. Some one in Halifax sent to Boston a statement charging
Fillis and Smith as being privy to the act. They complained to the
House of Assembly, then in session, when the following resolution
was passed: That this House do esteem Mr. Fillis and Mr. Smith to
be dutiful and lawful subjects to the King, etc., and that the
"House is unanimously of opinion that the said reports are base,
infamous and false, and that the authors thereof merit punishment."
The garrison having been reinforced by King's troops, the Governor
concluded on bringing no further drafts of militia to the town.</p>

<p>1776. This was a memorable year for Halifax. The British
forces under General Howe having evacuated Boston, a fleet of
three men-of-war and 47 transports arrived in the harbour on 30th
March, with troops and a number of inhabitants of Boston. These
were followed on 1st April by many more transports, nearly 100 in
number, with the remainder of Howe's army and a number of Loyalist
refugees. Howe demanded accommodation for 200 officers and
3000 men, and about 1500 loyalists with their families, with supplies
of fresh provisions, etc. Rents of houses in the town were consequently
doubled and the town soon presented the appearance of a
military camp.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Many complaints appear against the soldiers for
pulling down the fences and demolishing the stone walls on the
peninsula. One Christopher Schlegall had been killed in one of the
numerous affrays with the soldiers. Three soldiers were arrested
and tried for murder, but no convictions occurred. Several persons
were called on to give security for their good behaviour in the town.</p>

<p>Among the events of this year was the appearance in one of the
Halifax newspapers of copies of treasonable articles from the Rhode
Island and Boston papers. The printer was brought before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
Council and reprimanded and cautioned against permitting any such
publications again to appear in his paper.</p>

<p>The names of the Members of Assembly for Halifax County and
Town in 1776 were Wm. Nesbitt and Henry Smith, and Thomas
Bridge and Joseph Fairbanks. Mr. Fenton was still Provost
Marshall with jurisdiction throughout the province, there being then
no County Sheriffs at this time. Henry Newton was Collector of
Customs at Halifax, James Burrows, Comptroller, Lewis Piers,
Gauger of Liquors, etc.</p>

<p>The Magistrates of the town were John Creighton, John Burbidge,
Malachi Salter, Benjamin Green, John Cunningham, George
Cotnam, John Newton, Winkworth Tonge, Jos. Desbarres, Charles
Morris, Junior, George Smith, J. Gray, Giles Tidmarsh, George
Deschamps, Dan. Cunningham, Thomas Proctor and Thomas Bridge.</p>

<p>The death of Chief Justice Belcher occurred this year. Mr.
Morris, one of the assistant judges, was appointed to fill the office
of Chief Justice until another should be appointed.</p>

<p>1777. The jail at Halifax was at this time in a very insecure
condition. Criminals were continually escaping from it, several of
whom had been found guilty of being in arms against the King.
The jailor was infirm and his wife took charge. There were no
regulations enforced for visiting the prisoners at night, and the
shackles on the prisoners were found not to be sufficient. The
Provost Marshall was suspended and Mr. Bridge appointed to act
in his place.</p>

<p>Malcolm McIntyre, Thomas Crow, John Chalk, John Sewlock,
Samuel Miller, Robert McMullen, Tulley McKilley, Cornelius
O'Brien, Thomas Whitteny, John Cribben and John McIntyre, all
fishermen of Herring Cove, were this year rewarded for attacking
and taking a shallop and apprehending seven persons, being part of
the crew of an American privateer which had been driven on shore
and destroyed by the armed brig Hope, off Canso, from which they
had made their escape in the shallop.</p>

<p>1778. The names of John Hosterman, Thomas Stevens and
Edmund Phelan appear as Commissioners of the Poor, John Woodin,
Keeper of the Poor House, and Thomas Brown, Schoolmaster at
Halifax.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
On the 13th July, 1779, the Revenge, privateer, Capt. Sheppard
of Halifax, was taken and destroyed by two American armed
vessels. In December following, H. M. Sloop-of-War North and
the armed sloop St. Helena, in coming into the harbour from
Spanish River, Cape Breton, the night being very dark and a south-east
storm, were driven on shore about a league from the light
house; both were lost and 170 persons perished.</p>

<p>1780. This year the following gentlemen were in the Commission
of the Peace at Halifax: William Nesbitt, Winkworth Tonge,
John Burbidge, Benjamin Green, John Cunningham, John Newton,
Isaac Deschamps, William Russell, W. Phipps, J. F. W. Desbarres,
Charles Morris, junior, George Smith, Enoch Rust, Joseph Gray,
Giles Tidmarsh, John Fillis, George Deschamps, Daniel Cunningham,
Thomas Proctor, Thomas Bridge, George Sherlock and John
George Pyke.</p>

<p>A public slaughter house was erected this year in the town and
John Woodin, senior, made keeper.</p>

<p>March 12, 1780. John O'Brien advertizes as keeper of the
tavern known as the Golden Ball, formerly kept by Edward Phelan.
The Golden Ball was situate at the corner of Hollis and Sackville
Streets, opposite the building now called Variety Hall, occupied by
W. Harrington. The hotel called the Pontac, at the corner of
Duke and Water Streets (now Roger Cunningham's corner) was at
this time kept by one Willis. It was here the Town Assemblies,
Public Balls and Entertainments were held.</p>

<p>The Court House stood at the north-east corner of Buckingham
and Argyle Streets, where the store of Messrs. Northup &amp; Sons
now is. Chief Justice Belcher presided here when first appointed.
This building was, some years after, burned down and the lot on
which it stood, sold.</p>

<p>On the 15th January, this year, the town was illuminated and
there were great rejoicings throughout the day for the success of the
British troops in Georgia.</p>

<p>The Governor being informed from England that a large armament
was fitting out at Brest, it was resolved in Council that the
town militia should be called out for duty and a portion of the
country militia got ready to march to Halifax if required. General
McLean, then in command of the Garrison, was directed to put the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
fortifications in working order. The Halifax militia was employed
in the erection of bomb batteries. Drafts of militia from the
country came down and were employed for three weeks on the
works.</p>

<p>At this period the means of communication between this country
and England had been very uncertain. The intercourse of Halifax
with the old colonies having been cut off, Governor Sir Richard
Hughes urged on the British Government the necessity of a line of
packets being established between Halifax and England. Several
privateers, during this and the following years, were fitted out at
Halifax to cruise in American waters. The Revenge, Capt. James
Gandy, and the Liverpool, Capt. Young, the former mounting 30
and the latter 8 guns, sailed for Halifax early this spring. They
were accompanied by the Halifax, Robert E. Foster, master, owned
and fitted out by Alexander Brymer, one of the principal merchants
of the town.</p>

<p>The 18th of January being the Queen's birthday the citizens and
militia had a Ball at Willis' rooms in the Pontac.</p>

<p>In May, the Revenge brought in a richly laden Snow, bound from
Cadiz to Chesapeake Bay, the Blond Frigate and an armed sloop
both brought in American prizes.</p>

<p>For several years two large ships, the Adamant and St. Lawrence,
were regular traders between Halifax and Great Britain. They
were regular in their trips, spring and fall, and the merchants of
Halifax depended chiefly on them for their supplies of British
merchandize.</p>

<p>A government armed vessel called the Loyal Nova Scotian, and
several other small vessels, were kept to cruise off the mouth of the
harbour to prevent surprise from the pirates and privateer cruisers
which infested the coast. Several were captured and brought into
Halifax during this and the two following years.</p>

<p>In May, 1779, an election for the County took place in Halifax.
John George Pyke and Francis Boyd were the candidates. Pyke
was returned.</p>

<p>General McLean left Halifax in June with a force for the
reduction of Penobscot. In August, a squadron, consisting of
several men-of-war and some merchant vessels, among which were
the Adamant and St. Lawrence, sailed from Halifax for his relief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
The town continued to be infested with Press Gangs for the ships
of war. The inhabitants complained to the Governor and Council.
Several riots on the wharves having occurred in consequence of the
press, proclamation was issued demolishing all impressments except
under the sanction of the Governor and Council.</p>

<p>October 26th, 1780. The committee of the House of Assembly,
at this date, reported the sum of £1500 to be granted for the
erection of a "proper and convenient building in the town for a
public school, and a sum not exceeding £100 per annum for a
master, and £50 for an usher when the number of scholars shall
exceed forty." The trustees were to be five in number, to be
appointed annually by the government, and the £1500 was to be
raised by lottery. This lottery was carried into effect, but the
building does not appear to have been erected. How the proceeds
of the lottery were disposed of is not mentioned. The Halifax
Grammar School had its origin from this proceeding. It was
established in the old building at the corner of Barrington and
Sackville Streets, from which it has only lately been removed to the
private residence of the Rev. Doctor Gilpin, the Head Master. This
building was originally occupied as a place for the meeting of the
Legislature, and was previously at one time used as a Guard House.
It appears to have undergone very little alteration since 1780, until
sold a year or two ago. It is one of, if not the oldest building in
the city, except St. Paul's Church, and the old Dutch Church on
Brunswick Street. The Rev. William Cochran, afterwards Vice-President
of King's College, was the first head master. He was
succeeded by the Rev. George Wright, who was Garrison Chaplain
and minister of St. George's. On his death, in 1819, the Rev. John
Thomas Twining received the appointment. He retired from the
school in 1848, when the Rev. Edwin Gilpin, succeeded him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>At the commencement of the year 1781 many of the Loyalist
refugees who came to Halifax after the evacuation of Boston by the
British Army, had left the town, and the price of provisions was
beginning to come down. The constant influx of strangers, however,
from the revolted colonies, with the prisoners taken in the
prizes brought into the port by the privateers and ships of war,
tended again to augment the population. Captains of men-of-war,
when vessels were in port, in order to fill up their complements of
men, undertook to impress in the streets of the town without authority
from the civil magistrate. On the 6th January an armed party of
sailors and marines assisted by soldiers and commanded by naval
officers, seized in the streets of the town, some of the inhabitants
and several coasters belonging to Lunenburg, who had come up in
their vessels to sell their produce; bound their hands behind their
backs, carried them through the streets and lodged them in the
guard houses, from which they were conveyed on board the ships of
war in the harbour. The Grand Jury were in session at the time
and presented the outrage to the Sessions, who requested the
Governor, Sir Richard Hughes, to interfere. The Governor issued
his proclamation declaring all such impressments, without the
sanction of the civil authority, to be illegal and an outrageous
breach of the civil law, and calling upon all magistrates, etc., to
resist such proceedings and to bring the offenders to justice. It
does not appear, however, that the proclamation was sufficient to
procure the release of the unfortunate coasters. The names of the
Grand Jury on this occasion were William Meaney, William Graham,
Robert Kitts, Peter McNab, John Boyd, William Mott, William
Millett, junior, John Moore, William Carter, James Creighton,
John Cleary, Richard Jacobs and Charles Hill.</p>

<p>On the 13th January, this year, died Malachi Salter, Esq., aged
65 years. He was one of the first members of Assembly for the
town. His colleague in the representation was Joseph Fairbanks.
Mr. Salter came from Boston to Halifax, very soon after the town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
was commenced, and carried on business as merchant. He is said
to have visited Chebucto Harbour while engaged in the fishery,
several years before the arrival of Cornwallis in 1749. The old
building at the corner of Salter and Barrington Streets, formerly the
residence of the late Hon. William Lawson, afterwards owned by
John Esson, was originally built by Mr. Salter, and was his residence
for many years. This is one of the oldest houses now remaining in
Halifax. It received improvements, and was enlarged by Mr.
Lawson, about 60 years ago.</p>

<p>The School Lottery, before mentioned, was carried on this year.
It was divided into two classes. The first to consist of 5000 tickets,
at 20s. each, was advertised on the 25th September. The highest
prize was £2000. The prizes in all came to £4,250, leaving a
balance of £750 for the purposes of the school.</p>

<p>The most exciting occurence of the year was the arrival of the
Charleston Frigate, the sloop Vulture, and the armed ship Vulcan,
in July, after a sharp conflict with a French Squadron. The
Charleston had left the harbour a short time before in convoy of some
transports, and while out had taken several prizes, which had been
sent in a few days previously. On the 10th July, the Charleston
discovered near Spanish River, Cape Breton, two French Frigates,
of 40 guns each. Captain Francis Evans, of the Charleston, having
thrown out signals for the transports to make for a port, bore
down upon the enemy. The Little Jack, convoy to the Quebec fleet,
being in company, supported the Charleston and the Vulture.
Some time after the action began, Capt. Evans being killed by a
cannon shot, Lt. McKay, the succeeding officer of the Charleston,
under the direction of Capt. Dennis George,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> of the Vulture,
continued the action with the greatest coolness and bravery. Nor
was the Vulcan, armed ship, in the least deficient in giving signal
proof of the resolute determination of the troops on board, under
command of Capt. Ewatt, of the 70th Regiment. But notwithstanding
the superiority of the French, after an obstinate resistance
they were enabled to sheer off and bear away, and Capt. George
conducted his much-shattered little squadron into Halifax Harbour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
The Little Jack stuck to one of the French Frigates of 42 guns, but
was afterwards recaptured. On the 31st, the remains of Captain
Evans, were interred with military honors, under St. Paul's Church,
where his monument is still to be seen on the east side of the chancel.
He was a young man of great promise, and his premature death
was a loss to the service, and shed a gloom over the town, in which
he had made many friends.</p>

<p>This year (1781), Lord Charles Montague, who had been
Governor of one of the West India Islands, arrived at Halifax, with
200 of his disbanded corps from Jamaica. This nobleman died at
Halifax, from the effects of fatigue, in travelling over land from
Quebec to Halifax, in winter. He was buried under St. Paul's
Church, where a monument to his memory is to be seen near that
of Capt. Evans. He was a younger son of Robert, Duke of
Manchester.</p>

<p>1782. The continual intercourse at this time carried on with the
revolted colonies, rendered it necessary that a more strict system of
inspection should be adopted with respect to vessels and passengers
entering and leaving the port; accordingly Capt. Thomas Beamish
was appointed Port Warden. His duty was to grant passes to all
vessels and boats leaving, and to visit all those entering the harbour.
No vessel or boat was allowed to pass George's Island, in the night
time, or leave the harbour without sending a boat to the island, and
also producing a pass from the Port Warden; and all vessels coming
in were to be hailed from the island, and ordered to send their boat
on shore to the Market Slip, or public landing, to be examined by
the Port Warden before landing in any other part of the town.
The Port Warden's office was in the old building which formerly
stood at the corner now known as Laidlaw's Corner on Water
Street, just above the Steamboat Wharf. At this time the water
came up as far as the spot on the wharf, where Bauld and Gibson's
store or shop now stands.</p>

<p>The Governor, Sir Andrew Snape Hammond, went to England
this year, and was succeeded by Governor Parr. He received a
very flattering address from the inhabitants of the town. Hammond
was esteemed a good Governor, and had gained the good will
of the people by his courteous manners and desire to meet, as far as
possible, the wishes of the inhabitants in all municipal matters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
This summer 57 transports with troops, and the Renown, a fifty
gun ship, put into Halifax on their way to New York and Canada.
In October the Renown sent in a prize, laden with a rich cargo of
silks, etc. The naval ships Adamant and St. Lawrence made
their trips this season in 35 days.</p>

<p>Among the occurences this year was the conviction and sentence
of a man named William McLean, for street robbery, and the
murder of a Mrs. Ann Dunbrack in July, by persons unknown.
The grand Jury recommended McLean to mercy, but the
Governor and Council saw no reason to grant a reprieve, and he
was executed. Street robberies were at the time of frequent occurence
in the town.</p>

<p>Articles of peace between Great Britain and the United States of
America were signed in November of this year, and with France in
January following.</p>

<p>The principal public amusements in the town during the year
were subscription assemblies, held at the Pontac, and at Mrs.
Sutherland's Coffee House, every fortnight. The latter establishment
was in Bedford Row, opposite the Commissary offices. The
national societies dined together, and levees were held and parties
given at Government House on all public holidays. The Garrison
consisted of the 70th, 82nd and 84th Regiments, with Baron de
Seitz's<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Germans. Night riots were frequent, and continual
complaints appear to have been made before the Sessions, of signs
being removed from shops, and windows broken.</p>

<p>The views of the town and suburbs at this time show the fortifications
at Citadel Hill, Fort Needham and Point Pleasant. They
were supposed to have been taken by one Colonel Hicks, and were
engraved and published in London. These views were mere
outlines. Copies of them are to be seen at the Provincial Museum,
where there are also a series of views, very neatly executed in
copper plate, of the Government House, St. Paul's Church and
other parts of the town. These latter were published about 1776,
some six or seven years before those of Colonel Hicks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
Governor Parr and family came out in the ship St. Lawrence,
and assumed the government in October.</p>

<p>Benjamin Green, Esq., son of the Hon. B. Green, one of the
first members of Council, was elected member of Assembly for the
town in February, without opposition. Mr. William Shaw was at
the time Sheriff of the County.</p>

<p>In December, 1782, a large quantity of heavy ordnance was
brought to Halifax from Charleston, South Carolina; also 500
refugees, men, women and children, arrived about the same date.</p>

<p>In August, 1783, a number of Negro refugees arrived from New
York. It was resolved that they should be settled in different parts
of the Province; however, not a few remained in Halifax, and
became servants and labourers.</p>

<p>The Loyalists continued to come from the old Colonies, many of
them in a destitute and helpless condition, until the population of
the town was increased to three times its former number, and much
temporary suffering in consequence prevailed. Yet many intelligent
and enterprising settlers were at this period added to our
population, giving new life and spirit to the town. Many spacious
and commodious buildings began to be erected, taking the place of
the low gamble-roofed and picketed buildings of an early day. It is
very remarkable, however, that in the year 1791, only seven years
after this great influx, the population had again so decreased as
scarcely to exceed 5,000. In 1783, Governor Parr estimated the
population at only 1,200. This was before the Loyalist emigration
from New York. In 1784, one hundred and ninety-four Negro
men, women and children arrived in Halifax from St. Augustin's,
in a destitute condition; they did not remain in the town, but were
distributed by the Government throughout the interior parts of the
Province.</p>

<p>Governor Parr in his letter to England of November 20th, 1783,
says, "upwards of 25,000 Loyalists have already arrived in the
Province, most of whom, with the exception of those who went to
Shelburne, came to Halifax before they became distributed
throughout the Province."</p>

<p>Again in his letter of 15th January, 1784, he says, "In consequence
of the final evacuation of New York,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> a considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
number of refugee families have come to Halifax, who must be
provided for at the public expense. They are in a most wretched
condition, destitute of almost everything&mdash;chiefly women and
children, all still on board the vessels, and I have not been able
to find as yet any place for them, and the cold is setting in very
severe."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>On the 20th October, 1784, an advertizement appeared in a
Halifax paper, for sale, "All that land near the entrance of the
harbour and opposite to Cornwallis' Island, called Mauger's
Beach, containing by particular grant 5 acres according to the
plan attached to the grant." This beach had been formerly
occupied for curing fish, and had buildings erected thereon for that
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The Penal Statutes had been repealed in 1783. The Roman
Catholics in the town, chiefly emigrants from Ireland, having
become numerous, purchased a piece of ground in Barrington
Street, where they built a Chapel, which was dedicated to St. Peter.
The frame was erected on 19th July, 1784, and many of the
inhabitants, both Protestants and Roman Catholics, attended the
ceremony. This building stood in from the street, directly opposite
the head of Salter Street. It was painted red, with a steeple at the
western end. It was removed in or shortly after Bishop Burke's
time, on the completion of the new stone church, now St. Mary's.
The Rev. Mr. Jones was the first officiating priest. The Rev.
Edmund Burke, who came from Canada, officiated at St. Peter's for
many years before he was appointed Bishop.</p>

<p>A number of emigrants arrived in Halifax this year from
England. Three hundred passengers came in the Sally transport,
in a great measure destitute of clothing and provisions. Fresh
provisions became very dear, and the merchants of Halifax had flour
up to £3 10s. per cwt. The Governor and Council, in consequence,
ordered the admission of provisions from the United States to afford
relief to the inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
The House of Assembly was dissolved this year; it had sat
fourteen years without being dissolved, in consequence of the
American troubles. The only alteration in the Halifax representation
was the return of Capt. William Abbott for the County. Mr.
Francis Green, second son of old Councillor Green, was again
chosen Sheriff of Halifax in 1784.</p>

<p>1785. January 3rd, Mr. Sampson Salter Blowers, a barrister
from Boston who came among the Loyalists, was appointed Attorney
General in the place of Mr. Gibbons, who had received the appointment
of Chief Justice for the Island of Cape Breton, then a separate
province.</p>

<p>The Orphan house being no longer in use, was ordered to be let
on a lease for one year.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>In September, 1785, a number of whalers from Nantucket came
to Halifax; three brigantines and one schooner, with crews and
everything necessary for prosecuting the whale fishery, which they
proposed to do under the British flag. Their families were to
follow. A short time after they were joined by three brigantines
and a sloop from the same place.</p>

<p>On the twentieth of October following, the Chief Land Surveyor
was directed to make return of such lands as were vacant at
Dartmouth to be granted to Samuel Starbuck, Timothy Folger, and
others, from Nantucket, to make settlement for the whalers. The
Town of Dartmouth had been many years previously laid out in lots
which had been granted or appropriated to individuals, some of
whom had built houses, and others though then vacant, had been
held and sold from time to time by their respective owners. Most
of these lots were reported vacant by Mr. Morris, the surveyor, and
seized upon by the Government, as it is said, without any proceeding
of escheat, and re-granted to the Quakers from Nantucket,
which caused much discontent, and questions of title arose and
remained open for many years after.</p>

<p>At a Court of Admiralty held on Friday, the 27th August, 1785,
for the trial of piracies committed upon the high seas, M. Buckley
and Belitham Taylor were tried, committed and sentenced to death
for running away with the schooner John Miller of Chedabucto and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
her cargo. Two men were also hanged this year for robbery
committed to the eastward of Halifax.</p>

<p>The death of the Chief Justice, Bryan Finucane, having occurred
this year, Judge Isaac Deschamps filled the office until the appointment
of Chief Justice Pemberton. Judge Finucane was buried
under St. Paul's Church. His escutcheon is in the gallery.</p>

<p>A general election occurred in 1785, when Mr. S. S. Blowers,
John George Pyke, Richard John Uniacke and Michael Wallace
were returned for the County, and John Fillis and William Cochran
for the town.</p>

<p>The whale fishery was the chief subject which engaged the
attention of the public during the year. Much advantage was
expected to accrue to the commerce of the place from the Quakers
from Nantucket having undertaken to settle in Dartmouth. They
went on prosperously for a short time, until they found the commercial
regulations established in England for the Colonies were
hostile to their interests, and they eventually removed, some of them,
it is said, to Wales and other parts of Great Britain, where they
carried on their fishery to more advantage.</p>

<p>A petition was presented this autumn to the Governor and
Council from a number of merchants, tradesmen and other inhabitants,
praying for a Charter of Incorporation for the Town. This
was the first occasion on which the subject was brought prominently
before the public. It was, however, not deemed by the government
"expedient or necessary" to comply with the prayer of the petition.
The reasons are not given in the Minute of Council, which bears
date 17th November, 1785. The names of the Councillors present
were Richard Bulkeley, Henry Newton, Jonathan Binney, Arthur
Goold, Alexander Brymer, Thomas Cochran and Charles Morris.
The functions of His Majesty's Council at this period of our history
embraced all departments of executive authority in the Colony.
They were equally supreme in the control of town affairs as those
of the province at large. The magistrates, though nominally the
executive of the town, never acted in any matter of moment without
consulting the Governor and Council. The existence of a corporate
body having the sole control of town affairs would in a great
measure deprive them of that supervision which they no doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
deemed, for the interest of the community, should remain in the
Governor and Council.</p>

<p>1786. It was customary at this period to celebrate the Royal birthdays
and almost all public holidays by a levee at Government House,
a review of the troops in garrison on the Common, and occasionally
a public ball, either by the Governor at Government House or by
the inhabitants of the town at the public assembly room. This
custom continued in Halifax until about the year 1844 or 1845, when
it was broken through by Governor Falkland. On the 18th June,
1786, Queen Charlotte's birthday was celebrated in the town by a
levee and review, and in the evening by a ball in the old Pontac
building. The confectionery on this occasion was very superb. It
was prepared by one Signor Lenzi. The ball commenced at half-past
eight, supper was announced by the elevation of a curtain that
separated the two rooms. In the middle of the table there arose an
artificial fountain, with the temples of Health and Venus at the top
and bottom, all constructed of sugar. The Gazette of the time
says, they "did not go home till morning."</p>

<p>A regular post communication was opened this summer with
Annapolis; a courier was engaged, who went through once a
fortnight with the mail between Halifax and Annapolis. John
Howe, who had lately come to Halifax from Boston and had
established a newspaper, was at this time postmaster; he succeeded
Mr. Stevens. The following spring (1786) the town was so
enveloped in smoke for many days as almost to impede business,
caused by a great fire which raged in the woods in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On 10th October, 1786, arrived His Majesty's Ship Pegasus,
commanded by His Royal Highness Prince William Henry. He
was received at the King's Slip by Governor Parr and Major General
Campbell, then in command of the Garrison, and conducted to the
Government House, which stood in the square now occupied by the
Province Building, where he was waited upon by the military and
the principal inhabitants. The Prince expressed a desire that all
display should be laid aside, but the people illuminated their
dwellings, and by 8 o'clock the whole town was lighted and the
streets crowded with people.</p>

<p>In the Gazette of the 9th February, 1786, appears a resolution
and engagement entered into by the merchants and others at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
public meeting lately held in Halifax, wherein they pledged themselves
neither to buy nor sell articles imported from the United
States, prohibited by the Governor's proclamation. The document
is signed by 75 persons.</p>

<p>On 28th February, a German Society was formed in Halifax,
when John W. Schwartz was chosen President, Doctor F.
Gschwint, (pronounced Swint) Vice-President, Godfrey Schwartz
Treasurer, Henry Uthoff Secretary. In 1790 Adolphus Veith was
secretary of this Society.</p>

<p>On 4th March, the jail was broken open and the prisoners, six in
number, all escaped, of whom five were re-taken. Mr. Green
was then Sheriff. Inquiries were instituted, but no information
obtained. The delapidated and insecure state of the jail at the time
was the subject of public comment.</p>

<p>The money collected for Liquor Licences in the town, between
31st May, 1784, and 31st May, 1785, amounted to £531. Mr.
Francis Shipton was Clerk of Licences.</p>

<p>Three vessels were fitted out during the summer of 1786 for the
whale fishery,&mdash;the schooners Parr and Lively, and the ship
Romulus.</p>

<p>This year the merchants and shipowners formed themselves into a
society called the Halifax Marine Association, for the benefit of
trade. The following year Nova Scotia was erected into a Bishop's
See. The Right Reverend Charles Inglis was appointed Bishop.
He arrived from England on 16th October, and made Halifax his
residence.</p>

<p>On the 3rd July, 1787, the Pegasus, frigate, commanded by Prince
William Henry, arrived again at Halifax, 15 days from Jamaica.
On Friday, at half-past two o'clock, the troops were drawn up in
double line from the wharf to Government House. The Prince
landed at the slip under a salute from the artillery on the King's
Wharf. He was accompanied to Government House by the
Governor and Council, where he received an address from the
inhabitants. There was a dinner and ball at Government House in
the evening, and a brilliant illumination of the town.</p>

<p>This month two whalers returned bringing 1,060 barrels oil and
72 cwt. whalebone. It is not mentioned whether these vessels
belonged to the Quakers or to some of the merchants of the town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
On the 24th June, the Freemasons had a grand procession. They
walked to St. Paul's Church, where they heard a sermon from the
Rev. Mr. Weeks. The Prince reviewed the troops in garrison on
30th July, consisting of the 57th and 37th Regiments, and the first
Battalion of the 60th Regiment.</p>

<p>On the 7th July the fleet, consisting of the Leander, Commodore
Sawyer&mdash;Pegasus, Prince William Henry&mdash;Ariadne, Capt. Osborne,
the Resource, and the Brig Weazel, Commander Hood, fell down to
the beach, intending to proceed to Quebec the first fair wind. They
sailed on the 14th. The Pegasus, with the Prince, returned to
Halifax early in November. He received an address on the 6th,
from the House of Assembly then in Session. At two o'clock on
that day, the barge of the Pegasus with the Royal Standard flying,
preceded by the Commodore in his barge, with his pendant, and the
Captains of the other ships of war in their barges, proceeded slowly
in procession from their ships to the King's Wharf, where the party
landed under a salute of 21 guns. They were received at the stairs
by the Governor, Council and Assembly, and the troops, under
General Ogilvie, being ordered up, they proceeded to Government
House, where a number of members of the Legislature were presented
to him. They then proceeded through the lines of troops to the
Golden Ball,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> where a handsome dinner was prepared, and where
the Prince dined with the members of <a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>Assembly and the principal
officers of Government. He retired at 6 o'clock, after which a ball
was given in the evening at Marchington's new building in Water
Street, adjoining the Ordnance Yard, called the British Coffee
House. The Prince entered the ball room a little after 8 o'clock,
and at 12 the company were conducted into the supper room. The
table was handsomely decorated and contained places for 200
people. The Prince is said to have displayed great affability in
conversation on the occasion.</p>

<p>An Act was passed this Session authorizing the sale of the
Orphan House, the Court House, the Public Slaughter House, and
the Old Jail, and to erect a Jail, and also to erect on the Lower
Parade a Public Hall, a Province House of Brick or Stone for the
setting of the Legislature and Public Offices. The Commissioners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
appointed for this purpose were John Newton, Richard John
Uniacke, John George Pyke and Mr. Taylor. Such parts of this
Act as have been executed were afterwards repealed by Act of 1797.</p>

<p>1788. An Election for Members for the Town took place this
winter, which was attended with extraordinary excitement. On the
20th February the poll opened, at the Court House, in Halifax; the
candidates were Mr. Charles Morris and Jonathan Sterns. It closed
on the Friday following, when it stood: Morris, 415; Sterns, 274.
Majority for Morris, 141. Mr. Morris was carried through the
Town and then taken home to his father's house. Hand-bills had
been posted up reflecting on the government. Serious riots at the
election occurred and many persons were hurt, some of whom
received fractures of the skull and other severe injuries. Armed
persons paraded the Town assaulting individuals. As this was a
very remarkable election, and resulted in more turbulence and riot
than had ever before occurred in the town on such occasions, we
here copy the following extract from Anthony Henry's <i>Gazette</i> of
25th February:&mdash;"The unwearied and spirited exertions of a number
of respectable gentlemen in a great measure calmed the minds
of the people, and prevented their violence being carried to any
very great length; nevertheless it was utterly impossible, in such
confusion, to prevent many persons from being wounded and
hurt, two of whom, we are sorry to inform the public, remain
in a dangerous state; one having his skull fractured by some
persons who rushed out of Laycock's house on the beach, and
the other having been dangerously wounded by a shot from a
window in the same house. We are likewise sorry to inform
the public, that Mr. Benjamin Mulberry Holmes and his son,
have been much beaten and abused by the populace on Friday
night, and were it not for the very fortunate and timely interposition
of Mr. Tobin's man and some others, it is probable
they would have fallen a sacrifice to an enraged multitude."</p>

<p>The excitement had been caused partly by certain proceedings on
the part of the judges of the Supreme Court against Mr. Sterns and
Mr. Taylor, two practising lawyers in the town, whose names had
been struck off the roll by Chief Justice Deschamps. One of the
gentlemen, Mr. Sterns, was the defeated candidate at the election.</p>

<p>On the 3rd June, Bishop Inglis held his primary visitation of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
Clergy, when he delivered a charge, received an address, and held a
confirmation in the afternoon at St. Paul's, when one hundred and
twenty young persons went through the ceremony of confirmation.</p>

<p>A heavy rain-storm occurred on Saturday, 5th July, when the
streets of the town were very much injured by the torrents of water
which poured down the hills. It was estimated that the rainfall was
upwards of 186 tons of water to an acre, which, allowing the rain to
have fallen equally on the whole peninsula, would make the fall of
water on that small space equal to 345,000 tons, in four hours.</p>

<p>July 30. Arrived five sail of whalers, having on board the following
valuable cargoes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sloop "Watson," Danl. Ray, Master, 150 bbls. sperm,
50 do. headmatter.</li>

<li>Brigt. "Lucretia," J. Coffin, Master, 250 bbls. sperm,
300 bbls. black oil, and 3000 cut bone.</li>

<li>Brigt. "Somerset," S. Gardner, Master, 230 bbls. sperm.</li>

<li>Brigt. "Sally," P. Worth, Master, 200 bbls.       do.</li>

<li>Brigt. "Industry," W. Chadwick, Master, 84 bbls.   do.
26 bbls. headmatter, and 300 do. black oil, also
3000 cut bone.</li>
</ul>

<p>The "Andromeda," frigate, commanded by Prince William Henry,
from England, arrived on 17th August, 1788; he was again received
with the usual honours and the town was illuminated. The Prince
attended a sham-fight on the Common, on 10th September, in which,
the 4th, 37th, and 57th Regiments took part. Three soldiers were
wounded by bursting of their muskets during the performance.</p>

<p>On 21st October, the new Chief Justice Jeremiah Pemberton, took
the oaths and his seat on the bench, and his patent was then read in
open Court.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Oct. 22nd, was launched at the south end of the
town, a handsome brig, the property of Messrs. Gouge &amp; Pryor;
she was the first vessel of the size ever built in the town.</p>

<p>The following gentlemen composed the Magistracy of the town this
year, viz:&mdash;Benj. Green, John Cunningham, John Newton, Charles
Morris, George Smith, William Sherlock, John George Pyke, Thos.
Cochran, Anthony Stewart,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> W. Taylor, Stephen N. Binney, J. M.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
F. Bulkeley, Revd. Michael Houseal, James Gautier, William
Morris, Charles Morris, junior, Daniel Wood, junior; Matthew Cahill
was High Sheriff.</p>

<p>It appears that the rank of Esquire was not applied to any person,
at this or any previous period, except Magistrates and high public
functionaries, and persons to whom it was accorded in consequence
of their personal wealth and rank in society. Being a member of
the House of Assembly did not confer the title.</p>

<p>There was then no regular police establishment in the town, the
Magistrates, by turns, attended to police duties with the aid of the
town constables, who were annually appointed. All special matters
were discussed and settled at the special sessions, which was
generally a private meeting of Magistrates in the back office in
conjunction with the Clerk of the Peace. Criminal charges of a
delicate nature, or when private character was likely to be affected,
were usually investigated with closed doors, and no information
made public until found to be necessary for the ends of justice.
This system continued until Mr. John George Pyke received the
appointment of Police Magistrate, about 60 years since. His duties
were merely to relieve the Magistrates from the more onerous duties
of attending daily at the Police office. Colonel Pyke became
incapacitated by age about the year 1825 or 6, when Mr. John
Liddell was appointed, who had to his aid three or four Police Constables,
two of whom had attended his predecessor, and the valuable
assistance of David Shaw Clarke, the clerk of the peace. Such was
the arrangement until the Act of Incorporation in 1848.</p>

<p>The "Royal Gazette" was published by Anthony Henry, until
about 1801, when it fell into the hands of Mr. John Howe, from
Boston.</p>

<p>The "Weekly Chronicle," another paper, was at this time established
by Mr. William Minns, stationer, in Barrington Street,
opposite the north-end of the Grand Parade. It was commenced in
1787, and continued to exist until about 1828 or 9.</p>

<p>Among the merchants who advertized in these papers we find the
names of James Vetch, opposite the woodyard; David Hall &amp; Co.,
in Hollis Street, opposite Government House, (Crown Prince Building);
and George Bell, Granville St. The shops appear to have
contained both groceries and dry-goods, like the country stores of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
the present day. A. &amp; R. Leslie were at the corner of Duke and
Water Streets, near the Pontac. Lawrence Hartshorne, Hardware,
corner of Granville and George streets, between the market house
and the parade. This old corner, so many years known as
Hartshorne &amp; Boggs' corner, had a gun at the corner of the platform
which extended down the hill to the lower corner, occupied by one
Hart, a Jew, afterwards known as Martin Gay Black's, and now
occupied by the new building of the Merchant's Bank; this walk
was the resort of the merchants in the morning, and the fashionable
and idle in the afternoons.</p>

<p>1789. On the night of Friday, the 23rd January, Cochran's
buildings, a range of three-storey buildings in the market square,
were totally consumed by fire. Firewards were John Fillis, J. G.
Pyke, R. J. Uniacke, Michael Wallace, Geo. Bell, Lawrence
Hartshorne, William Lawlor, Charles Hill.</p>

<p>On 9th February, an advertisement appeared in the "Gazette,"
as follows: "I am directed by His Excellency the Governor, to
acquaint the several gentlemen called upon on Friday last to form
a Fire Company, that he desires their attendance at the 'Golden
Ball' on Thursday next, at twelve o'clock, to agree to rules and
regulations. (Signed) Jas. Gautier."</p>

<p>On 15th August, the jail was broken open, and a prisoner for debt,
one Livesay, who had been imprisoned at the suit of William Stairs,
escaped, for which Sheriff Green was prosecuted; Green stated
that he had repeatedly represented to the Council the insecure state
of the jail. Mr. James Clarke succeeded Mr. Green as Sheriff of
Halifax, this year.</p>

<p>The Dockyard at this period was in full operation. The
Commissioner in charge was the Honorable Henry Duncan, who
was also a member of His Majesty's Council. Doctor John
Haliburton, father of the late Chief Justice Sir Brenton Haliburton,
was Surgeon of the Naval Hospital, Mr. Provo Wallis was Master
Superintendent, Elias Marshall, foreman of shipwrights, William Lee
foreman of carpenters, Alexander Anderson and Provo F. Wallis,
Chief Clerks.</p>

<p>A great scarcity of bread was felt in the town this summer.
Vessels sent to Canada for wheat, returned empty. On the 9th July,
the Governor received a letter from the Governor of Canada, stating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
the great scarcity of provisions in the Province of Lower Canada or
Quebec, that a famine was dreaded, and requesting him not to
obstruct the exportation of corn and flour from Halifax to Quebec.
But the Justices of the Quarter Sessions presented a memorial which
had been laid before them by the bakers of Halifax, setting forth
that there is not more of flour in the town than sufficient to provide
bread for three or four days, whereupon it was ordered by the
Council that no vessel be permitted to clear out with bread or flour
to Quebec, except the brigantine "Ceres," until further consideration.</p>

<p>There were amateur theatrical performances this winter at the
Pontac. It would appear that the old theatre in Argyle Street, in
the recollection possibly of some of the oldest inhabitants, was in
operation this year. We find plays advertized to take place there
in February and March. This building stood on the spot on which
the present Acadian School was afterwards erected. It was the
only theatre in the town during the time of the Duke of Kent. It
was afterwards occupied by Walter Bromley as a public school upon
the Lancaster plan, until removed to make way for the present
building, in the year 1816.</p>

<p>The first Agricultural Society was formed in Halifax in the year
1789; the Hon. Richard Bulkeley was the first president, and Mr.
James Clarke,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> (afterwards Sheriff Clarke,) was the first secretary.</p>

<p>The old Block House on the Citadel Hill being in a ruinous condition,
was taken down this year, but the flag and signal staffs
which were on it, were preserved.</p>

<p>June 1, 1789. The old gaol and garden were offered for sale at
auction. This old building was in Hollis Street, nearly opposite the
present Halifax Hotel, and was formerly the property of the late
Mr. Robert M. Brown.</p>

<p>On the 16th June, in conformity with the Act of the Legislature
formerly passed, the Governor was pleased to nominate Hon. Henry
Newton, Hon. Thos. Cochran, James Brenton, John Newton and R.
J. Uniacke, Trustees of a Grammar School forthwith to be erected
in the town. "These gentlemen chose Mr. William Cochran, of
Trinity College, Dublin, and lately Professor of the Greek and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
Latin languages in Columbia College, New York, to be master.
Mr. George Glennie, who was regularly educated in the University
of Aberdeen, to be usher, and Mr. Thomas Brown, already well
known in this town, to be teacher of writing, arithmetic and
mathematics. It is thought proper to give this early notification
to the public, but until a suitable building can be provided, the
school will be opened without delay in the room where the
Assembly of the Province meets."</p>

<p>The Legislature after this met in the building known as Cochran's
building, which was erected at the Market Square after the fire
before mentioned, and the old building appropriated permanently
for the Grammar school, which remained so until lately, when the
school was removed to the private residence of Mr. Gilpin, the head
master, and the old building sold.</p>

<p>The following advertizement appeared in the "Royal Gazette":
"Information for Masters of Vessels. The Block House on Citadel
Hill, which was a conspicuous object, is removed, having been in
a ruinous condition. The flag and signal staffs remain." "The
hulk of the large ship, sometime since stranded at the back of
Thrum Cap, was beaten to pieces in the last gale."</p>

<p>On the 15th October, Charles Hill advertized for sale at auction,
the ground where the Court House stood, now known as Northup's
Corner; measuring on Buckingham Street, 94 feet, and on Argyle
Street 43 feet. On the 17th July previous, the old Court House,
and the building adjoining, known as Kirby's soap-house, and other
buildings, were destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>1790. In the month of July, this year, the whaling fleet arrived,
after a successful voyage. The brig "Prince William Henry," Capt.
Pinkham, with 110 barrels of sperm oil; brig "Hibernian," Capt.
Worth, 100 barrels sperm and 32 black oil; ship "Parr," Capt.
Chase, 480 sperm and 100 black oil, and brig "Harvest," Capt.
Kelly, with 200 sperm. In August following arrived the "Romulus,"
with 170 bbls. sperm oil.</p>

<p>Among the chief merchants of the town at this time were William
Forsyth, Philip Marchington,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Brymer &amp; Belcher, Hardware<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
merchants, successors to Thomas Robie; Michael Wallace, retail
store-keeper; James Moody, Hollis Street; Sabatier, Stewart &amp; Co.,
Chas. Geddes, dry goods, lower side of the Parade; Richard Kidston,
general merchandize; George Deblois, William Millet, Charles
Hill, Hugh Kelley, all auctioneers. John W. Schwartz kept store at
the corner of Granville and Buckingham Streets; Lawrence
Hartshorne, at his corner, had a general assortment of cutlery, etc.,
D. Hall &amp; Co., in Hollis Street, opposite Government House; Ann
Bremner kept a dry goods shop at the north-west corner of the parade;
Peter Lynch kept a hat store at the sign of the "King's Arms;"
C. C. Hall &amp; Co. was the chief dry goods store in the town; Benjamin
Salter, Ship Chandlery, Water St.; John Fillis &amp; Son and G. &amp;
J. Thirlock were among the wholesale dealers; Linnard &amp; Young
were the fashionable tailors; Richard Courtney had a shop at the
lower side of the parade, William Sellon in Granville Street, King
&amp; Story in Marchington's buildings, John Butler Dight, wholesale
store in Marchington's buildings; C. C. Hall &amp; Co. had this year
removed to Marchington building; Winkworth Allen, general
dealer, in Cochran's new building. Mr. Wm. Millet the auctioneer,
on the 9th Sept. advertized for sale, "a negro man and sundry
other articles." In the following year, James Forman &amp; Co. occupied
a store on Copeland's wharf, also Benjamin Salter. The
British Coffee house was kept by John Gallagher at the head of
Marchington's wharf. Mrs. Sutherland's coffee house, was at this
time, one of the chief places of resort for Public Committees and
Societies, as well as for Public entertainments; concerts were held
here throughout the winter, commencing in September. The
Halifax Marine Society, which had been established in Halifax for
several years, held their quarterly meetings at this house. There
was a house of entertainment then kept on McNab's Island by one
Mary Roubalet, for tea parties in the summer. It was called the
Mansion House.</p>

<p>On the 12th day of January, 1790, James Clarke and George
Geddes, Church Wardens of St. Paul's, advertized that in consequence
of the inclemency of the weather on Sunday there was so
small an attendance in church, that the contributions towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
clothing of the children in the Sunday Schools in the town, were so
small, that they desired to invite contributions from the inhabitants
for the relief of the orphans and others attending the schools. In
February following, the church wardens again advertized the distribution
of clothing to the poor children of the Sunday Schools: 15
great coats, 64 shirts and shifts, 70 pairs stockings and 35 pairs
strong shoes, which cost £30 7s. 2d. The St. Paul's school had
nineteen boys and sixteen girls in attendance.</p>

<p>On the same day, there was a visitation of the Halifax Grammar
School by the Governor, the Bishop, the Trustees and others. The
attendance during the winter was usually about 60. The school was
addressed on this occasion, by one of the elder boys, and after the
examinations in the Latin classes, writing and arithmetic, several
scholars repeated pieces and dialogues. Mr. Cochran was the headmaster;
he shortly afterwards accepted the charge of the Academy
at Windsor; and the Rev. George Wright was appointed in his place.
His salary was £150 per annum from the Legislature, with what he
could get from the pupils. The number of scholars was 68. He
states his loss in the shape of discount on his Treasury warrants
amounted to from 15 to 20 per cent., in consequence of the delay in
payment.</p>

<p>The winter was very severe; The harbour was frozen over, and
the destitute condition of the poor very great. The gentlemen
amateurs of the theatre, sent £25 to the Rev. Mr. Weeks, of St.
Paul's, Dr. Andrew Brown, of the Presbyterian meeting house, and
Mr. Houseal of St. George's in Dutchtown, for the poor of their
respective parishes. The overseers of the poor, Jonathan Tremain,
James Gautier, James Kerby and Andrew Belcher, met at the
"Golden Ball," to assess the inhabitants of the town for the poor
rates.</p>

<p>The Court House having been destroyed by fire, the Quarter
Sessions held their sittings on the 19th February, in the long room
of the "Golden Ball," for the trial of offenders. The "Golden
Ball" was kept by Edward Phelan this winter, who occupied the
north end of the building as a store for general merchandise.</p>

<p>An Act of the Legislature had been passed this year, and was
published early in May, reciting that the destruction of the Court
House by fire, and the inconvenient situation of the present Assembly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
House, made it necessary that a more suitable place should be
provided, and the state of the Province finances not being such as to
admit of the expense of erecting a proper and suitable building, it
was therefore enacted, that Commissioners be appointed to treat
with Thomas James and William Cochran, for their building opposite
Government House, for £200 per annum, and to expend £100 in
furniture for the purposes of the meeting of this Legislature and
the Courts of Law. This building lately erected after the fire, stood
on the spot now occupied by the new Dominion Public building, and
continued to be the place of holding the General Assembly, the
Courts of Law, etc., until the Province Building was completed for
their reception in 1820. The building in which the Legislature formerly
held its sittings, and which was now appropriated for the
Grammar School, was this year repaired at the public expense.</p>

<p>In June, the Grand Jury addressed Chief Justice Strange on
his arrival from England. The names of the Jury were:&mdash;Richard
Kidston, foreman, William Millet, Lawrence Hartshorne, Godfrey
Schwartz, Winkworth Allen, John Davis, J. Forbes, James Lewis,
Benjamin Salter, James Strachan, William Lawlor, Martin Shier,
John Boyd and Alexander Copeland.</p>

<p>In the autumn, the Secretary of the Province announced to the
people of the town, that in the event of a war with Spain, and the
withdrawal of the troops from the Province, it would be necessary
to call out the Militia for the defence of the town, and the Colonels
of regiments were called upon to hold themselves in readiness,
and to make returns of the state and condition of their respective
regiments.</p>

<p>About this time, Captain Stack was a regular trader between this
port and Ireland, and sold his cargoes of beef, salt pork, lard, etc.,
at auction, at Charles Hill &amp; Co.'s rooms.</p>

<p>The Halifax Bar addressed Chief Justice Strange, on his leaving
for England on a visit, this autumn. The address was signed by
S. S. Blowers, R. J. Uniacke, James Sterns, E. B. Brenton, James
Stewart, Daniel Wood, Foster Hutchinson, J. Prout and W. H. O.
Haliburton.</p>

<p>At a Court of Quarter Sessions, held at Halifax, in June term of
this year, the Sheriff, pursuant to law and by virtue of a warrant
directed to him by the Justices of the Sessions, to lay out a road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
in the north suburbs of the town, reported that he had laid out the
road by a jury, in the manner following, viz:&mdash;Beginning at the
north-east corner or angle of Lot No. 2, on the road leading from
the Dockyard to the Naval Hospital; thence to run north 28 west,
40 feet; thence north, 59 east, 238 feet, which leaves a road of 40
feet wide, between Allbright's ground and the Hospital fence;
thence north, 28 west, 660 feet; thence north 20 west, 664 feet to
the road leading to Fort Needham, leaving the road 50 feet wide
between the shore at the Narrows at high-water mark, and the Lots
Nos. 3 and 4. This notice was published, that all persons who
might think themselves aggrieved by the laying out of the road
might have an opportunity of being heard before the sessions, on
Tuesday, the 5th September, 1790. It was signed by Thomas
Wood, Clerk of the Peace.</p>

<p>This road was intended as a continuation of Water Street northward,
to meet the road which leads up from the water to Fort
Needham, but it does not appear to have been on the line of the
present road, but to have gone through the northern end of the
Hospital grounds, along the water side, below the site of the old
magazines.</p>

<p>At the session of the House of Assembly in 1790, several articles
of impeachment against the Judges of the Supreme Court, as before
mentioned, passed the House, which were laid before the Executive
Council by the Governor, on 7th April. It was proposed to suspend
Chief Justice Deschamps and Judge James Brenton, in
conformity with the request of the Assembly.</p>

<p>1791. Governor Parr died on 25th November this year, in the
66th year of his age, and the ninth of his government. He was
buried with military honours, under St. Paul's Church, on the 29th
of the month. The procession moved from Government House to St.
Paul's Church, in the following order:&mdash;All the Lodges of the Freemasons,
(His Excellency having been the Grand Master,) the 20th
regiment as the firing party, the Church Wardens, the Physicians of
deceased, the Clergy, the Bishop, the body covered by a pall adorned
by eight escutcheons, Pall-bearers, Hon. A. Brymer, Major Boyd,
the Commissioner of the Dockyard, the Admiral, the Hon. S. S.
Blowers, Hon. Thomas Cochran, Major Rawlinson, the General, the
relatives and servants of deceased, particular friends, the Sheriff of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
the county, members of Council, viz., Morris, Bulkeley and Newton,
Judges Brenton and Hutchinson, the treasurer of the province, the
Speaker of the House of Assembly, Custos of the county and Justice
Binney, Magistrates of the town, the bar, staff of the army,
officers of the navy and army, officers of militia, gentlemen of the
town, and the whole garrison all under arms, lining the streets.
Minute guns were fired by the men-of-war in the harbor and by the
Royal Artillery, during the procession. The service was performed
by the bishop, Dr. Charles Inglis, and the body was buried under the
middle aisle.</p>

<p>During the autumn and winter, a number of black people from
different parts of the province were brought to Halifax, to be
removed to Sierra Leone. Michael Wallace was agent, who on 5th
December, advertised for 1000 tons of shipping, for the purpose.
Ships "Venus," "Parr," "Eleanor;" Brigs "Betsy," "Beaver,"
"Mary," "Morning Star," "Catherine," "P. W. Henry;" Schrs.
"Liberty," and "Two Brothers," the whole commanded by Lieutenant
Clarkson, having on board the colored people, all sailed for
Sierra Leone on 15th January, 1792. The hire and damages
amounted to £3965 8s. 0d. sterling. This expense was borne by the
Sierra Leone Company. These colored people were chiefly those
who came from the old provinces with the Loyalists. They formed
a colony in Africa, called the "Nova Scotia colony,"<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> which still
exists, and about 15 years since several old negroes were living who
recollected the removal from Halifax, when children. The fleet
arrived at their destination after a passage of 40 days. The number
embarked was 1139. The day of arrival was 28th March, and
the 28th March in every year is still kept up by the adherents of
the Lady Huntingdon Congregation at Sierra Leone, as the
anniversary of the arrival of their fathers in the colony.</p>

<p>Until these Nova Scotian adherents of Lady Huntingdon's connection
could erect a chapel for themselves in their new home, they united
with the other coloured congregations of Methodists and Baptists.
Mr. Zachary Macaulay, who was at one time Governor of this colony,
says: "There were five or six black preachers among the Nova Scotians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
raised up from their own body, who are not without a considerable
influence." Among these, was John Ellis, who was Superintendent
of the churches; he was succeeded by Anthony Elliot, a young
Nova Scotia negro; he acquired several of the native dialects and
became an active Christian missionary in Africa. He died in 1854
at the advanced age of 80. Elliot followed the avocations of a fisherman
and pilot as the means of livelihood, and on the Sundays he
preached to the people the word of Life.</p>

<p>The population of the city and suburbs, in 1791, had fallen to
4,897.</p>

<p>The Agricultural Society of Halifax, offered premiums this year,
and published a volume on husbandry.</p>

<p>A gold medal and 10 guineas was offered for the best essay on
the natural history of the Hessian fly, and the method of stopping its
progress in the wheat crop. A volume of the Society's proceedings,
was this year published at Halifax by John Howe.</p>

<p>1792. On the 17th April news arrived of the appointment of Mr.
John Wentworth as Governor. He had resided in Halifax for seven
or eight years, having held the office of Ranger of woods and forests,
and had been Governor of New Hampshire. On 12th May, the
"Hussar," frigate, Capt. Rupert Denis George, arrived, having on
board Governor Wentworth, etc. He landed at the King's wharf
under a salute fired from the parade and a guard of honour from
21st regiment. On the 14th he was sworn into office. In the evening
the town was brilliantly illuminated.</p>

<p>On 17th August a fire broke out in the property of John Welner,
soap-maker in Granville Street. Six tenements and the Ordnance
laboratory were consumed; Welner and his wife, two aged persons,
were burnt to death. The sum of £140 was raised by subscription
for the sufferers at the fire. The principal sufferers, however, declined
to receive any aid, and a committee was appointed to
examine the claims and distribute the fund.</p>

<p>Folger and Starbuck, the Quaker whalers, who settled at Dartmouth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
a year or two since, left Halifax this year, for Milford
Haven, in Great Britain, where they expected to carry on their
whale fishery with greater facilities than at Dartmouth.</p>

<p>Died at Halifax, on 27th September, 1792, Mrs. Hester Godfrey,
aged 101 years.</p>

<p>The Grand Jury at Halifax, for 1792, were as follows, viz:&mdash;George
Smith, foreman, Andrew Liddell, John Masters, Philip
Marchington, Benjamin Mulberry Holmes, Rufus Fairbanks, Peter
Smith, Michael Wallace, John Steeling, Richard Jacobs, John Kirby,
Thomas Filles, Charles Hill, J. W. Schwartz, William Cochran,
John Butler Dight,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Thomas Russell, Alexander Brymer, George
Grant, William Williams and George Deblois.</p>

<p>Several petitions were presented this year to the Governor and
Council, from the merchants and others of Halifax, on the subject
of trade regulations and the collection of debts. Among the signatures
to these petitions, we find the names of James Forman &amp; Co.,
James Moody, William Veitch, George Grant, Winkworth Allen,
William Kidston, Samuel Rudolph, Benjamin M. Holmes, James and
Alexander Kidston, Chas. Geddes, Wm. Forsyth &amp; Co., Thomas
Russell, Hall, Bremner &amp; Bottomry, William Taylor, Burnes,
Liddell &amp; Co., P. Smith, Jonathan Masters, Williams &amp; Lyons,
Geo. Deblois, John Moody, and S. Hall &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Again 1793: Brymer &amp; Belcher, Forman &amp; Grassie, John Steeling,
Jonathan Tremain, P. Marchington, Andrew Liddell, George Sherlocke,
Francis Stevens, Geo. Bell, Geo. Moren, Edward Butler,
Nathan Hatfield, Thomas Watson, Peter McNab, Benjamin Salter,
Frederick Major and John Brown.</p>

<p>The town Assemblies were held this winter in Mrs. Sutherland's
rooms in Bedford Row, opposite the Commissary offices.</p>

<p>On Thursday evening, Dec. 20th, 1792, Governor and Mrs.
Wentworth gave a grand ball. The decorations in the supper room
were very elegant. The ladies sat down and the gentlemen waited
on them. Among the decorations were the exact representations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
Mr. Jonathan Tremain's new flour mill at Dartmouth, of the windmill
on Halifax Common. A model of the red light house at
Shelburne, and the tract of new road from Pictou, was delineated in
the most ingenious and surprising manner, as was also the representation
of our fisheries.</p>

<p>To all these inimitable ornaments, corresponding mottoes were
attached, so that not only taste and elegance were conspicuous, but
encouragement and genius were displayed. Such was the description
of this affair as it appeared in the newspapers of the day.</p>

<p>Cochran's buildings were again on fire, 30th January, 1793, but
the fire was extinguished without much damage.</p>

<p>War with France was announced by letters from the Secretary of
State to the Governor, dated 9th February, 1793. Orders were also
received to raise a provincial regiment. This regiment was to be
called the Nova Scotia Fensibles; they were to be raised in Halifax,
but were not to have half pay, and the Commissions were to be given
to half pay officers. Young Haligonians were thus excluded. It
was about the same time decided on embodying a part of the Militia
force for the defence of the town. 1050 effective men were accordingly
marched into the town from the country, who were to receive
pay from the British Government while on duty. The Governor
published his thanks to the militia on 2nd November, for the alacrity
with which they obeyed his orders in marching to Halifax. By the
month of May the number of men enlisted for the Nova Scotia
regiment, amounted to 100, the enlistments were afterwards increased
to 600 men.</p>

<p>Apprehensions appear to have been entertained of an attack on
the town by the French fleet. Every precaution appears to have
been taken by Governor Wentworth for the protection of the
Capital. In his letter to the Secretary of State of 23rd July, the
Governor says, "In twenty minutes I could put under the command
of General Ogilvie, 900 militia men, and in a few hours a second
battalion of 600, who reside in the neighbourhood of the town."</p>

<p>The Halifax Militia Artillery, commanded by Capt. J. Tremain
was a most effective body of men. It had been this year formed
and consisted of sixty freeholders of the town. The Town Regiment
of Infantry was commanded by Col. John George Pyke.
550 men of the Town Militia assisted the Garrison in repairing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
and mounting the batteries on Citadel Hill and elsewhere. On the
2nd April, two French Prizes were brought into the harbour by
H. M. Ship Alligator, with cargoes valued at £40,000.</p>

<p>Among the events of the War was an expedition fitted out at
Halifax to attack the Island of St. Pierre, in Newfoundland. It
consisted of the Alligator and Hussar, men-of-war, with a body of
troops under General Ogilvie. Before leaving, the two ships of war
received permissions from the Governor and Council to press
through the town and complete their crews. The place surrendered
without fighting, and the Governor, M. Danseville, with several
hundred prisoners and stores were brought to Halifax. They
landed on the 20th of June. Governor Danseville was placed on
parole, and resided at Dartmouth for many years in the house known
as Brook House, now or lately the residence of the Hon. Michael
Tobin, junr., about a couple of miles or more from Dartmouth
town. The old gentleman displayed some taste in beautifying the
grounds at Brook House. He built a fish pond and laid out walks
among the beech and white birch groves near the house. The
pond still remains, but the walks and most of the trees have long
since disappeared. He remained a prisoner with an allowance from
Government until the peace of 1814, when he returned to his own
country a zealous royalist. Mr. Mizanseau was his aide-de-camp;
he married a farmer's daughter in the South East Passage, and left a
family who bear his name in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Governor Wentworth proposed to place the French prisoners who
had been brought to Halifax from time to time, on an Island in the
North West Arm, afterwards known as Melville Island, but the
General preferred the Cornwallis <a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>Barracks. The Island was not
the property of the Government at this time, but hired by Governor
Wentworth for this purpose of a prison. It afterwards became
Admiralty property.</p>

<p>A poll tax existed at this time. It had been imposed by Act of
the Legislature in 1791. One shilling per head was imposed on all
males above 21 years of age. The law also contained a tax on
cattle, with an extra tax on certain trades and occupations. It was
ostensibly for the purpose of reducing the provincial debt. It does
not appear, however, to have been regularly collected in the town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
1794. On the 10th May, His Royal Highness Prince Edward
arrived at Halifax in the Blanche Frigate, twelve days from St.
Kitts. He landed immediately under a salute of 21 guns.</p>

<p>A levee took place on the 14th and an address was presented to
him couched in the most fulsome and ridiculous language. On the
24th there was a garrison review under the command of General
Ogilvie.</p>

<p>On the 22nd January, the following year, he set out by land for
Quebec. He was at Boston on 5th February, where he remained 10
days and then embarked for the West Indies. It appears, however,
that he was in Halifax on 25th February.</p>

<p>1794. This year a number of merchants of the town agreed to
underwrite policies of insurance on vessels and goods, and appointed
Benjamin Salter the broker, who, on the 10th May, advertised
attendance every day during "change" hours at the "Coffee Rooms."</p>

<p>The town was again harassed by press gangs from Admiral
Murray's ship. The Admiral had persuaded the Governor and
Council to allow him twenty-four hours power over the inhabitants
to man his fleet&mdash;though Capt. Home had been previously refused
the privilege in January.</p>

<p>In December the Marine Society, which had been established by
the merchants of Halifax several years previously, was re-modeled
and extended in its operations. About this time a project had been
formed by Governor Wentworth for uniting the waters of Halifax
Harbor with the Bay of Fundy by a canal from the River
Shubenacadie, and rendering the river navigable. Suggestions on
the subject had been made to Governor Wentworth by persons whom
he supposed competent to judge of the feasibility of the project, and
was very sanguine of success in the work if not interrupted by
hostilities. It does not appear, however, that any attempt was
made this year towards effecting the object, but three years after
(1797) the sum of £250 was voted for a survey of the projected
canal.</p>

<p>All public lands in the town were this year granted to trustees.
A grant of part of the King's Stores for a fishmarket was made,
also the Province Building ground and the Grand Parade. The old
English burial ground opposite the present Government House on
Pleasant Street had been originally set apart, in 1749, as a general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
burial place for the inhabitants of the town. It consisted of two
acres and a quarter, but the title had not passed out of the Crown.
It was this year granted to the Church Wardens and Vestry of
St. Paul's Parish. They have been considered to hold it in trust
for the original purpose for which it was dedicated. The old poor
house burial ground was also included in this grant.</p>

<p>The French prisoners brought from St. Pierre and Miquelon, who
had been lodged in the town with others who had been taken in
prizes, were sent, in the month of July, to the Island of Guernsey.</p>

<p>We find Captain George of the Hussar receiving permission from
the Council to fill up the complement of his men by impressment.
In July following a similar application from Capt. Knowles of the
ship Daedalus was refused. Admiral Murray, it appears, obtained
another license in September to press through the town for seven
days.</p>

<p>Commodore George informed the Governor that intelligence of
the state of the defences of the town had been, or was likely to be,
communicated by the French prisoners, through persons from the
United States, to the French ambassador at Washington, and
suggested an embargo on all vessels going to the United States for
the present until he should receive intelligence from Admiral
Murray. The Collector of the Customs at Halifax was accordingly
ordered not to clear any vessels to the United States until further
orders.</p>

<p>The following gentlemen were added to the Magistracy of the
town: Michael Head, M. D., George Sherlock, Francis Green,
J. M. F. Bulkeley, J. B. Dight, John Phillips, M. D., Johnathan
Tremaine. James Clarke was Sheriff. Among the advertisements
which appeared in the newspaper this and the previous year was a
notice that sedan chairs would stand for hire in Barrington Street,
also at the Court House, for the convenience of the public. The
principal merchants and ship owners in the town between 1787 and
1795 were Geo. Bell, Hardware and Glass Store in Granville Street,
near the town guard, then kept in the old house behind Masons'
Hall; Peter Smith, Wines &amp; Groceries; James Veitch, Groceries
and General Store, shop opposite the wood yard; David Hall &amp; Co.
Dry Goods Store in Hollis Street, opposite old Government House;

Hollis Street; Edmond Phelan, "Golden Ball" tavern, Hollis
Street; Wm. Brindley, Wines, etc., Forman, Grassie &amp; Co.,

Moody, Dry Goods, Matthew Richardson, General Store, Robert
Chrisley, Dry Goods, John McMasters, Dry Goods, Edward King,
Livery Stable, John Kidston, General Dealer.</p>

<p>In 1798 the firm of L. Hartshorne &amp; Co. was changed to
Hartshorne &amp; Boggs.</p>

<p>Moody &amp; Tidmarsh, Dry Goods, Thos. Wallace, Dry Goods, etc.,
opposite wood yard; J. Hemmington, Grocer, near the Navy Yard;
Lyon &amp; Butler, General Dealers, Saml. Leddiet, Soap Boiler from

Street, Michael Wallace, Wines, Groceries, etc. C. C. Hall &amp; Co.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
appear to have been the leading dry goods shop keepers; their store
was in Marchington's buildings near the Ordnance. Charles Hill,
Auctioneer, James Forbes, Wine, Groceries, etc., Water Street,
near Fairbanks' Wharf. Andrew Gallagher kept the British Tavern
opposite Marchington's Wharf. Sabatier, Stewart &amp; Co., General

<p>1795. At the request of Prince Edward, the men of the Militia
were employed on the fortifications in the neighborhood of the town
during the summer. At this time the French prisoners in the town
became very riotous; they were ordered to be removed to a place of
confinement and none to be permitted at large. Several French
prizes were brought in during the summer by Capts. Cochran and
Beresford, of the Hussar and the Thetis, Sloops-of-War. An
armed Snow named the Earl of Moira was kept by the Provincial
Government for the protection of the coast. The most stirring
event of the year was the arrival of the Hussar and Thetis after a
long cruise bringing with them two French ships-of-war which they
had captured; part of the enemy's squadron bound from the West
Indies to Virginia.</p>

<p>Several Halifax ship masters lost their vessels and were made
prisoners by French privateers in 1795. The names of Capts.
Jacobs, Lloyd, Ewing and John Pryor appear among them. They
suffered much hard usage at Guadaloupe where they were detained.
A project for building a bridge across the Narrows was contemplated
about this time. A petition was presented to the House of Assembly
dated 11th March, 1796, from a number of persons praying for an
Act to authorize the building of a bridge across the Narrows.</p>

<p>Between January, 1795, and January, 1796, the Halifax markets
appear to have been well supplied. The newspapers of the day
mention that 786 head of fat cattle, 30 cows and calves, besides
sheep and swine had been brought into the town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
1796. St. George's day was celebrated with much festivity by
the English Society. They had a dinner in the evening at which
Governor Wentworth and Prince Edward were present. Among
the decorations were sixty variegated lamps. Genl. Ogilvie and
Chief Justice Strange were among the guests. The Prince arrived
and departed under a royal salute and, during the dinner, sat under
a canopy of white satin and gold lace.</p>

<p>During the spring of 1796 Halifax suffered from a scarcity of
provisions. The inhabitants were indebted to Messrs. Hartshorne
and Tremain, whose mills at Dartmouth enabled them, through the
summer, to obtain flour at a reduced price and to afford a sufficient
supply for the fishery.</p>

<p>The 4th June, old King George's birthday, was celebrated this
year with the usual ceremonies. There was a levee and a review of
the troops, and Sir John Wentworth entertained the Prince and a
number of the principal inhabitants at a Ball, when the old Government
House was brilliantly illuminated. There was a dinner the
same afternoon among the merchants at the British Tavern, Marchington's
buildings.</p>

<p>St. Patrick's day, this year, was also celebrated by a levee at the
Government House and a dinner at Gallagher's hotel. The society
sat down to dinner at five o'clock. His Royal Highness Prince
Edward, Governor Sir John Wentworth, several members of
Council, the Speaker and a number of members of the House
of Assembly attended. The Prince and the Governor retired early,
but the society kept up their festivities to a late hour.</p>

<p>On July 21st, vessels arrived in the harbor with five hundred
Maroon negroes from Jamaica. The Maroons were the descendants
of a number of African slaves, who, when Jamaica was conquered
from the Spaniards, took refuge in the Island. They continued in
a state of insubordination, but occasionally made treaties with the
English. At this time they were in open hostility, but had been
conquered, and it was arranged that a number of them should be
sent as settlers to Canada. They put into Halifax on their way.
They were under the superintendence of Colonel Quarrell of Jamaica,
who had letters from the Governor of Jamaica to Sir John Wentworth.
Prince Edward was commander of the garrison at the time,
and on inspecting the people was so much pleased with the athletic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
proportions of the young mulatto men that he proposed to detain
them to work on the fortifications of the town, which were then in
progress under his direction. The French squadron under Admiral
Richery was then off the coast, and it was expected that he would
visit Halifax. The fortifications at the mouth of the harbor having
fallen into decay were under repair, but, not sufficiently forward to
afford protection in case of an attack. The proposal was accepted
by the Maroons; some were accordingly accommodated with sheds,
and others placed in barns and such places of shelter as could be
found in the town for their temporary accommodation. A number
were sent to work on Citadel Hill, and one of the bastions there
was called the Maroon Battery. The assent of the Secretary of
State having been obtained for their settlement in Nova Scotia, land
was assigned them in the Township of Preston. Col. Quarrell did
not like the treatment they received. Many of the Maroons were
permitted to come to town and seek work among the inhabitants.
It was about this time that Sir John Wentworth proposed, as has
been before mentioned, to open communication between Halifax
and the River Shubenacadie which was to be performed by Maroon
labor. This was the first proposal to be met with in reference to
the Shubenacadie Canal which, in after years caused so much loss
and suffering by its failure. Differences arose between Col. Quarrell
and the Governor, the Maroons refused to work, and discontent
increased. Sir John and Prince Edward had a project of forming
them into a corps of militia, and bestowed militia commissions on
several of the young men among the Maroons, and two of their
leading men, Montagu and Johnson, were appointed Colonels.
Jarret, Bailey, Mayers and others were made Majors and Captains,
which gratified their vanity.</p>

<p>The winter of 1796-7 was very severe, the want of provisions
was felt, and the scarcity of flour threatened a famine in the town.
The expenses of supplying these people had hitherto been borne by
the Jamaica Government. Land had been purchased at Preston
and the large building known as Maroon Hall, afterwards the
property of Lieut. Katzmann, was erected as a residence for the
superintendent. Some difficulties arose with the Jamaica Legislature.
Quarrell left Halifax in the spring of 1797, leaving the Maroons
discontented and refractory. It was finally arranged that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
should be sent to Sierra Leone. Eight years previously a number
of negroes had been sent there from Halifax. The Maroons were
to be united with them in the hope that the union would be a check
on the turbulent conduct of the Nova Scotia colony, which at that
time had been the source of some trouble to the Sierra Leone
Company. They were accordingly embarked in the autumn of 1800,
and arrived on the coast of Africa in October.</p>

<p>Sir John Wentworth had received intelligence in September which
led him to apprehend some attempt on Halifax by the French forces
now in Newfoundland. At the close of the year the harbor
defences were brought into good condition, and capable of affording
a tolerable defence in case of invasion. Two press warrants were
issued this year by the Council; one on 31st January to Admiral
Murray for twenty-four hours in the town, and another in October
to Admiral Vandiput for two months through the province.</p>

<p>On the night of the 21st March a fire broke out in the range of
houses opposite St. Paul's Church, in Barrington Street, which
consumed the property of Dr. Greaves. The trees around the
Church escaped uninjured.</p>

<p>The sudden death of James Michael Freke Bulkeley, the Secretary
of the province, on the 12th November, threw a gloom over the
community. He was a young man of pleasing address and highly
esteemed. He had been for some time member for the county,
which he held in conjunction with that of Provincial Secretary. He
had succeeded his father, Richard Bulkeley, in the office but a short
time before his death.</p>

<p>In November, the fleet, under Vice Admiral Vandiput, sailed
from Halifax on a cruise. It consisted of the Resolution, 74,
bearing the Admiral's flag, Capt. Ledmore; Assistance, 50 guns,
Capt. Mowatt; Andromeda, 32 guns, Capt. Taylor; Ceres, 32,
Capt. Otway; Lynx, 18, Capt. Hall, and the Hunter, 18, Capt.
Tucker.</p>

<p>1797. During this summer the town was enlivened by the
presence of four or five hundred embodied militia who did garrison
duty. Several battalions were enrolled in the country with the
intention of their being removed to Halifax for the protection of the
town in the absence of the regular troops. They were, however,
not required, and were discharged in the latter part of October by
order of the Governor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
At this time Dr. Robert Stanser was rector of St. Paul's, Dr.
Archibald Gray, minister of St. Matthew's, at the corner, Mr.
Michael Bernard Houseal, missionary to the Germans and minister
of St. George's, north suburbs. Chief Justice Strange resigned this
year and was succeeded in the office by Mr. Sampson Salter Blowers,
who remained Chief Justice until 1835, when he was succeeded by
Sir Brenton Halliburton. Chief Justice Blowers died in 1842, at the
age of 100 years. His monument is in the south-east corner of the
east aisle of St. Paul's. He built the house at the corner of
Barrington and Blowers Streets, lately occupied by Mr. Romans as
a hotel, and known as the Waverley House, where he resided for
about thirty-five years.</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw was Sheriff of Halifax this year; he was succeeded by
Lewis M. Wilkins, afterwards a Judge of the Supreme Court, and
father of the late Judge Wilkins of that Court.</p>

<p>Prince Edward, who was Commandant of the garrison, appears
to have patronized almost all the public entertainments in the town.
He dined with the national societies, and honored the balls given by
Governor Wentworth with his presence. His manners were affable,
and he was, in consequence, quite popular with all classes in the
town. He was very much affected by the sudden death of Lieutenant
Charles Thomas of his own regiment, the 7th Fusiliers, who
was accidentally shot by a brother officer while on a hunting
expedition in August of this year. Lieut. Thomas was the son of
Nathaniel Ray Thomas, a magistrate and collector of the customs
of Windsor, and a cousin of Governor Wentworth. He was a
favourite and protegé of Prince Edward, who attended his funeral
and erected a monument at his own expense over his grave.</p>

<p>On the 23rd November, this year, H. M. Ship La Tribune, Capt.
Baker, was lost in coming into the harbor. The following authentic
account of this disaster is from the newspaper of the day:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"La Tribune was one of the finest frigates in His Majesty's service,
mounted 44 guns and had been lately captured by Captain Williams in the
Unicorn frigate. She was commanded by Captain S. Barker, and sailed
from Torbay the 22nd September, as convoy to the Quebec and Newfoundland
fleets. In Lat. 49° 14´ Long. 17° 29´ she fell in with and spoke His
Majesty's ship Experiment from this place, out 12 days. She lost sight of
all her convoy October 19th, in Lat. 46° 16´ Long. 32° 11´. On Thursday
morning last, they discovered this Harbour about 8 o'clock. The wind being
E. S. E. they approached it very fast, when Captain Barker proposed to the
master that they should lay the ship to till they could obtain a pilot; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
master replied, 'he had beat a 44 gun ship into the harbour&mdash;that he had
been frequently here and that there was no occasion for a pilot, as the
wind was fair.' Confiding in these assurances Captain Barker went below
and was for a time employed in arranging some papers he wished to take
on shore with him. The master in the meantime taking upon himself the
pilotage of the ship, and placing great dependence upon the judgment of a
negro man by the name of John Casey, (who had formerly belonged here)
whom he had placed forward to con the ship. About 12 o'clock the
ship had approached so near the Thrum Cap Shoals, that the master
became alarmed and sent for Mr. Galvin the master's mate, who was sick
below. On his coming on deck he heard the man in the chains sing out
'by the mark five,' the black man forward at the same time singing out
'steady.' Galvin got on one of the carronades to observe the situation of
the ship, the master in much agitation at the same time taking the wheel
from the man who was steering with an intent to wear ship, but before
this could be effected or Galvin able to give an opinion, she struck.
Captain Barker instantly came on deck and reproached the master with
having lost the ship. Seeing Galvin also on deck, he addressed him and
said (as he knew he had formerly sailed out of this harbour) that he was
much surprised that he could stand by and see the master run the ship on
shore. Galvin informed the Captain he had not been on deck long enough
to give an opinion. Signals of distress were instantly made and answered
by the military posts and the ships in the harbour. Boats from all the
military posts, from His Majesty's ships and from the Dockyard, proceeded
to the relief of La Tribune. The military boats and one of the boats from
the Dockyard, with Mr. Rackum, boatswain of the Ordinary, reached the
ship; but the other boats, though making the greatest exertions, were not
able, the wind being so much against them, to get on board. The ship was
immediately lightened by throwing all her guns, except one retained for
signals, overboard, and every other heavy article, so that at about half-past
eight o'clock in the evening the ship began to heave and about nine she got
off from the shoals. She had before at about five or six o'clock lost her
rudder, and on examination it was now found that she had seven feet of
water in the hold. The chain pumps were immediately manned and such
exertions made that they seemed to gain on the leaks, and by advice of Mr.
Rackum the Captain ordered to let go the best bower anchor. This was
done but it did not bring her up. The Captain then ordered them to cut the
cable, and the jib and fore topmast stay sail were hoisted to steer by. All
this time the violent gale, which had come on from the south east, kept
increasing and carrying them to the western shore. In a short time the
small bower anchor was let go, at which time they found themselves in about
thirteen fathoms water. The mizzen mast was then cut away. It was now
about ten o'clock, the water gaining fast on the ship, little hope remained
of saving the ship or their lives. At this critical period Lieut. Campbell
quitted the ship. Lieut. Nooth was taken into the boat out of one of the
ports. Lieut. James of the Royal Nova Scotia Regiment, not being to be
found was so unfortunate as to remain, and to the great distress of his
worthy parents and friends shared the general fate. From the period
when Lieut. Campbell quitted the ship all hopes of safety had vanished,
the ship was sinking fast, the storm was increasing with redoubled
violence, the rocky shore to which they were approaching resounding with
the tremendous noise of the billows which rolled toward it, presented
nothing to those who might survive the sinking of the ship, but the
expectation of a more painful death from being dashed against those
tremendous precipices, which even in the calmest day it is almost impossible
to ascend.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
Dunlap, one of the survivors, informs us that at about half-past ten, as
nearly as he could conjecture, one of the men who had been below came to
him on the forecastle and told him the ship was sinking; in a few minutes
after, the ship took a lurch as a boat will do when nearly filled with water
and going down; immediately on which Dunlap began to ascend the fore
shroud, and at the same moment casting his eyes towards the quarter deck
saw Capt. Barker standing by the gangway and looking into the water, and
directly after heard him call for the jolly-boat. At the same time he saw the
Lieutenant of Marines running towards the taffrail, he supposed to look for
the jolly-boat, as she had previously been let down with four men in her&mdash;but
instantly the ship took a second lurch and sank to the bottom; after
which neither the captain nor any other of the officers was seen. The
scene, sufficiently distressing before, became now peculiarly awful&mdash;more
than 240 men, besides several women and children were floating on the
waves making their last efforts to preserve their existence. Dunlap,
whom we have before mentioned, gained the fore top. Mr. Galvin, the
master's mate, after incredible difficulty, got into the main top&mdash;he was
below when the ship sank, directing the men at the chain pump. He was
washed up the hatchway, thrown into the waist and from thence into the
water, and his feet as he plunged, struck a rock. On ascending, he swam
to gain the main shrouds when he was suddenly seized hold of by three
men&mdash;he was now afraid he was lost. To disengage himself from them he
made a dive into the water which induced them to quit their hold. On
rising again he swam to the shrouds and arrived at the main top and
seated himself on an arm-chest which was lashed to the mast.</p>

<p>From the observations of Mr. Galvin from the main-top and Mr.
Dunlap in the fore-top, it appears that near one hundred persons were for
a considerable time hanging to the shrouds, the tops and other parts of the
wreck; but from the extreme length of the night and the ferocity of the
storm nature became exhausted, and they kept at all periods of the night
dropping off and disappearing. The cries and groans of the unhappy
sufferers, from the bruises many of them had received and as their hopes
of deliverance began to fail them, were continued through the night;
though as morning appeared from the few that then survived they became
feeble indeed. The whole number saved from the wreck amounted to
eight persons and several of them so exhausted as to be indifferent
whether they were taken off or not. Mr. Galvin mentions that about
twelve o'clock the mainmast gave way; at that time he supposes there
were on the main-top and on the shrouds upwards of forty persons. By
the fall of the mast the whole were again plunged into the water, and of
that number only nine besides himself regained the top. The top rested
upon the main yard, and the whole remained fast to the ship by some of
the rigging. Of the ten persons who regained the main-top four only
were alive when morning appeared. Ten were at that time alive on the
fore-top, but three of them had got so exhausted and had become so unable to
help themselves that before any relief came they were finally washed
away; three others perished, and four only were also finally left alive in
the fore-top. The place where the ship went down was only about three
times her length to the southward of the entrance into Herring Cove. The
people came down in the night to the point opposite to which the ship
sunk and kept large fires, and were so near as to converse with the people
in the wreck.</p>

<p>The first exertion that was made for their relief was by a boy, thirteen
years old, from Herring Cove, who ventured off in a small skiff by himself
about eleven o'clock the next day; and this truly deserving young lad
with great exertions and at extreme risk to himself ventured to approach the
wreck and backed in his little boat so near to the fore-top as to take off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
two of the men, for the boat could not with safely hold any more; and here
a trait of generous magnanimity occurred which deserves to be noticed.
Dunlap and Munroe had, throughout this disastrous night providentially
preserved their strength and spirits beyond their unfortunate companions,
and had endeavoured to cheer and encourage them as they found their
spirits sinking; they were now both of them able to have stepped into the
boat and put an end to their own sufferings, but their other two companions,
though alive, were unable to help themselves. They lay exhausted
on the top, wished not to be disturbed, and seemed desirous to perish as they
lay. These generous fellows hesitated not a moment to remain themselves
on the wreck and to save, though against their will, their unfortunate
companions. They lifted them up and by the greatest exertions got them
into the little skiff, and the manly boy rowed them triumphantly to the
Cove and instantly had them conveyed to a comfortable habitation.
After shaming, by his example, older persons who had larger boats, he put
off again in his little skiff, but with all his efforts he could not then approach
the wreck. His example, however, was soon followed by the men in the
Tribune's jolly-boat and by some of the boats of the Cove, and by their
joint exertions the eight men were preserved, who, with four that escaped
in the jolly-boat make the whole number of survivors of this fine ship's
company.</p>

<p>Some have been disposed to blame Capt. Barker as exhibiting too
much obstinacy in not abandoning the ship and preserving his crew, as a
violent storm was evidently approaching, but on examining the men who
have survived we find (though other officers in the same situation might have
formed a different judgment) that the conduct of Capt. Barker was throughout
the trying scene completely cool and collected. Though from the
manner in which the ship had been run ashore, no blame could attach to
him, yet he could not reconcile it to himself to lose so fine a ship without
making every exertion to save her. Having by the greatest efforts considerably
lightened her, he had reason to suppose she might get off before
high water. She made no water while she lay aground, there was therefore
great hopes, if she could not that night have been got up the harbour that
she might with safety have been brought to anchor and have rode out the
gale. When she finally got off, universal joy was diffused throughout the
ship&mdash;every man thought the object of their joint efforts was attained&mdash;but
the rapid manner in which the water poured into her, soon damped their
joy and plunged them into despair. Had the ship been finally saved by
the great exertions which were made to effect it, every man would have
praised Capt. Barker, and, notwithstanding those exertions failed, we
think we may justly say, in the language of Mr. Addison,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis not in mortals to command success<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Barker did more; he did deserve it"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To his memory therefore and that of his brave fellow-sufferers, the commiseration
of their countrymen is justly due. From every generous heart
they will receive that commiseration; and while the mind runs over the
whole trying scene the tears which must involuntarily flow will embalm
their memory.</p>

<p>Having closed the general scene, we think it will not be unacceptable
to our readers if we notice the conduct of some individuals. A quartermaster
belonging to the ship, by the name of McGregor, had his wife on
board; they were a respectable couple and greatly attached to each other.
McGregor from his affectionate solicitations for her safety, endeavoured to
persuade her, while the ship lay on the shoals, to go ashore in one of the
boats which came off from the Island, as his mind would be more at ease,
could he put her in a place of safety. To his solicitations she replied,
'that she never would abandon him; if it was his lot to perish, she wished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
not to survive him.' Finding it in vain to urge her further, he desisted
from the attempt and she afterwards shared the common fate. A considerable
time after the ship had foundered a man was discovered swimming
towards the wreck. On his approaching near it was found to be McGregor;
he informed his comrades who were hanging by the wreck, that he had
swam towards the shore; that he had ventured as far as he could with
safety into the surf, and found if he went further he should be dashed to
pieces, and he cautioned them all to avoid making a like attempt, but if
possible to hold by the wreck. He himself gained the main shrouds and
remained there till the mast gave way, and then met the same fate as his
unfortunate consort, whose death he was continually deploring while on
the shrouds.</p>

<p>Dunlap relates another instance which occurred, which though it
may appear ludicrous after the distressing scenes we have noticed, is so
descriptive of that cool thoughtlessness of danger which so often distinguishes
our British tars that it would be inexcusable to omit it. Daniel
Munroe, one of the survivors had as well as Dunlap got into the fore-top.
After a while he disappeared and it was concluded that he had been
washed away with many others; after an absence from the top of about
two hours, he suddenly popped his head up through the lubber hole to the
surprise of Dunlap, who enquired where he had been; he said he had been
cruising about for a better berth; and it appeared that, after swimming
about the wreck for a considerable time, he had returned to the fore shrouds,
and crawled in on the cat-harpins and had actually been to sleep there
more than an hour, and he said he was and really appeared to be greatly
refreshed.</p>

<p>Mr. Brennan of the Dockyard, who had gone aboard with Mr. Rackum,
after the sinking of the ship, had got on the maintop and remained there
till the mainmast gave way and was never after seen.</p>

<p>While noticing the immediate disasters of the ship, we forebore to
mention the fate of one of the boats which had gone from George's
Island. About nine o'clock as the ship went off, the boat got under the
ship's bow and was upset; by this circumstance a part of the men, consisting
of two sergeants and four privates of the Royal Nova Scotia Regiment were
unfortunately drowned; the remainder were taken up by the boat belonging
to the Eastern Battery. Too much praise cannot be given to the men
who manned these boats, and particularly to Sergt. Bourke, and the boat's
crew who persevered in following the ship, and finally brought off Lieuts.
Campbell and Nooth of the Royal Fusiliers.</p>

<p>Great praise is also due to the dock-yard boat which carried Mr.
Rackum on board. They followed the ship at a short distance till she
foundered, and with extreme difficulty at length reached Herring Cove.
We are sorry to mention that Mr. Rackum, whose exertions on board
La Tribune to preserve the ship were gratefully acknowledged, perished
with the unhappy ship's company.</p>

<p>Having mentioned all the disastrous circumstances which have
attended this distressing scene, it is with pleasure we now notice the
attention which has been paid to the widows and children of the unfortunate
sufferers. His Royal Highness Prince Edward with that uniform
generosity which has distinguished his Royal Highness during his
residence in this province, directed immediate provision to be made for the
bereaved families, and there is reason to hope through his Royal Highness'
representations, that provision will be made as permanent as their
sufferings. Actions like these dignify even kings and add splendour to the
highest rank.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
Besides the attention shown by his Royal Highness a liberal subscription
has been made by the garrison and gentlemen of the town for the
widows of the soldiers who were drowned and for the men who manned
the boats.</p>

<p>There is another instance of generosity, which the occasion seems to
require, and it seems to be the earnest wish of the men who were saved
from the wreck; it is that some reward may be bestowed on the boy who
first came off to them. They attribute in a great measure their deliverance
to him, and they mention with the warmest gratitude, not only his
exertions to save them from the wreck, but his kind and hospitable
attention to relieve them after they had reached the Cove. Surely if a
subscription were set on foot there is not a man in the country who would
not give something to reward and encourage so young an instance of
humane and heroic magnanimity.</p>

<p>Mr. Club, the master of La Tribune, was master of the Active, frigate
when she was run ashore on the Island of Anticosti.</p>

<p>Mr. Fennel, first lieutenant, and Mr. Galvin, the master's mate, were
both formerly prisoners at Guadeloupe with Colonel Wetherall, and were
all for a considerable time chained by the legs together. Lieut.
Fennell declared to Lieut. Campbell that his only motive in coming out in
La Tribune was to have the pleasure of seeing Colonel Wetherall; and
such appears to have been the attachment of Galvin to Lieut. Fennel that,
though he speaks with becoming feeling of the fate of the ship's company,
the loss of Lieut. Fennell seems peculiarly to affect him. On enquiring of
him if he saw Lieut. Fennell after the ship sunk, he replied, he did not, for
if he had, though he was himself in a place of apparent security, he would
again have risked his life to preserve him, and would have effected it or
perished with him. A similar attachment to each other appears among
the men who have survived the wreck, and these circumstances unite to
prove that the virtues which render human beings the most pleasing are
those they are taught in the trying school of adversity.</p>

<p>We have been favored with the following extract of General Orders
dated Halifax, November 26, 1797:</p>

<p>Lieutenant General, His Royal Highness Prince Edward thinks it his
duty to return his particular thanks to Lieutenants Haliburton, Campbell
and Nooth of the Royal Fusiliers, also to the several non-commissioned
officers and privates of the Royal Nova Scotia Regiment, who manned the
boats sent to give assistance on Thursday last to His Majesty's frigate
Tribune, unfortunately wrecked by getting on shore at the mouth of this
harbour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
His Royal Highness most sincerely laments the loss of Lieut. James
and two non-commissioned officers with four privates of the Royal N. S.
Regiment, who were unfortunately drowned in executing the first of all
duties, that of giving succor to brother officers and men in distress.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness directs that the Commissary-General will serve
free rations to the widows of the non-commissioned officers and privates
lost, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>To the wife of Sergt. Baker, and two children, two rations.</p>

<p>To Sergt. Mullen's wife, one ration.</p>

<p>To the wife of John Bush and two children, two rations.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tuesday last the body of Lieut. James was found and brought up to
town to his disconsolate parents&mdash;and Wednesday was interred with
military honors."</p>

<p>Michael Wallace was appointed Treasurer of the Province in
October of this year on the resignation of Benning Wentworth.
Mr. Wallace remained treasurer until 1827 or 1828, when he was
succeeded by his son. Mr. Wallace administered the government
as senior councillor several times during the absence of the
Governor, Sir James Kempt.</p>

<p>The old playhouse lot in Argyle Street was granted, about this
time, to James Putnam, from whom it came into possession of the
trustees of the Acadian School. The grant from the Crown of part
of the King's Stores for a fishmarket, before referred to, was, on
29th August, signed by the Governor and the Prince as commander
in chief of the troops. This is what was called the new fishmarket.
The old market had formerly been private property, and the rents of
stalls at this time were received by Mr. Cochran, but it was subject
to town regulations. Commissioners were about the same time
appointed to purchase land and to erect buildings for the accommodation
of the Legislature and Courts of Justice as soon as peace
should occur and the price of labor should be lower. The Act
formerly passed for erecting buildings for this purpose on the
"lower parade" was repealed, and that of 1797 was amended in
1799 and the Commissioners were directed to purchase land in the
south suburbs, and build a Government House.</p>

<p>The winter of 1797-8 was again very severe. The heavy falls of
snow rendered the road from Halifax to Windsor impassable. The
Prince ordered the troops to clear the road between the town and
his residence on the Basin. The supply of fat cattle from the
country for the troops was retarded for a long time by the state of
the roads.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
It was proposed to raise a fund in the town to be at the disposal
of Government for the purposes of war. The inhabitants subscribed
a sum approaching £4000 towards this fund; the officers of the
Royal Nova Scotia Fencible Regiment, £200. The boys of the
Grammar School contributed about £24, and the regiment in garrison
and the officers in the public departments, including the contributions
of the Nova Scotia Regiment, amounted to £2097. Much
enthusiasm on the subject prevailed, and great loyalty was displayed
by the people.</p>

<p>A general fast was proclaimed on 21st May, which was kept at
Halifax with much solemnity.</p>

<p>A commission was issued in July to William Forsyth, Andrew
Belcher, William Cochran, Lawrence Hartshorne, Charles Hill,
Richard Kidston, John Bremner, William Sabatier and Michael
Wallace, as directors for the Shubenacadie Canal. A survey and
report was made by this committee which was printed and published.</p>

<p>There were several regular traders at this time between Halifax
and Boston. The principal and most regular one was the Schooner
Nancy, Captain Tufton.</p>

<p>In the month of January, 1798, a boat arrived in the harbor with
Capt. Wyatt and several passengers of the Brig Princess Amelia,
bound to Halifax, which had been wrecked on the south side of
Sable Island on 9th November. The wreck had been reported by
an American schooner, who saw signals of distress on the Island.
Sir John Wentworth immediately sent a vessel to the Island with
clothing and provisions for the relief of the sufferers. Capt. Wyatt
equipped his long boat and, having got over to the north side of
the Island, embarked with four of his crew and Lieut. Cochran of the
Fusiliers, one of the passengers, intending to seek relief. He
arrived safe in one of the harbors to the eastward of Halifax, where
he obtained a pilot who brought him to Halifax. Capt. Parker,
who had charge of the vessel sent to the Island, brought off the
remainder of the crew and passengers in safety.</p>

<p>1798. On the 8th August, this year, Prince Edward received an
injury by a fall from his horse while riding on one of the streets in
the town. The horse broke through a defective wooden bridge over
one of the street gutters. The horse rolled over him hurting one of
his legs; it did not, however, prevent him from attending to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
military duties. He was recommended by the physicians to go to
England for further advice. An address subscribed by about four
hundred of the inhabitants was presented to him on his departure,
which took place on the 21st October, when he embarked in H. M.
Ship Topaz, Captain Church. The House of Assembly had previously
voted five hundred guineas to purchase a star of the order of
the Garter to be presented to His Royal Highness.</p>

<p>Among the events of the year was the arrival in the harbor, in
November, of the United States Squadron, consisting of the Sloop-of-War
Herald, Capt. Stevens, and the Pickering, Capt. Chapman,
with the Brig Commerce, Capt. Childs. Salutes were exchanged,
and the captains landed and paid their respects to the Governor,
Admiral and General, and were hospitably entertained. The United
States was at this time at war with France.</p>

<p>On the 25th November news of Nelson's victory at the Nile
arrived in Halifax. The town was illuminated in the evening.
Salutes were fired and other demonstrations of joy occurred throughout
the day. A number of prizes were brought into the port during
this autumn.</p>

<p>Mr. James Stewart, afterwards Solicitor-General, was this year
elected without opposition for the county.</p>

<p>On the 25th September a tremendous hurricane visited Halifax
and continued through part of the night. Nearly all the wharves in
the town were swept away, and most of the shipping in the harbor
damaged. The tide rose to an unprecedented height, overflowed
Water Street and did much damage to property. The water came
up to the old market house where the city brick building now stands.
The market wharf and King's wharf were partially destroyed, and
the market slip or public landing swept away. The loss of property
in the town, including the shipping, was estimated at above
£100,000.</p>

<p>Among the names of persons engaged in business in the town
this year we find, James Kidston, Wholesale and Retail Dealer,
Matthew Richardson, at the foot of Prince Street, James Moody
and James Tidmarsh just entered into co-partnership; Forman &amp;
Grassie, Fraser, Thom &amp; Co., Shipping Merchants, Lyon &amp; Butler,
Shopkeepers, near the market house; Thomas Moody, Dry Goods,
etc., corner of Marchington's wharf; James Leaver, opposite the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
Dartmouth Mill Flour Store, in Water Street; John McMasters,
Benjamin Etter, Watchmaker and Hardware Store at the corner of
George and Barrington Streets, lower side of Grand Parade
(Crosskill's corner); Phoebe Moody, Dry Goods, opposite the
Parade, in Barrington Street. In the following year the names of
Jonathan and John Tremain, Samuel Hart, Tremain &amp; Boggs and
William Annand appear.</p>

<p>The members of Assembly for the county were: Michael Wallace,
Jonathan Sterns, Lawrence Hartshorne and Charles Morris. Mr.
Sterns was replaced by James Stewart.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> William Cochran and
J. G. Pyke were still members for the town. Mr. Benning
Wentworth was Provincial Secretary. The Hon. Richard Bulkeley,
the senior councillor, was Grand Master of the Masons.</p>

<p>The papers of the day are filled with long advertisements about
the Government Lottery.</p>

<p>1799. The chief event which occupied the attention of the good
people of Halifax during the autumn of this year was the arrival
and movements of His Royal Highness Prince Edward, who had
now been created Duke of Kent. Having received the appointment
of commander-in-chief of the troops in British North America on
6th September, he arrived in H. M. Ship Arethusa, Capt. Wooley,
forty-three days from England. The Prince landed in state. A
procession of boats was formed from the frigate to the King's Wharf
under a royal salute from the ships, and on reaching the wharf, by
a salute from the Citadel. A double line of soldiers, including the
militia, lined the street from the King's Wharf to Government House,
through which the procession passed. The Governor and Council,
Admiral Vandiput, General Ogilvie, the officers of the staff and
public departments and a number of the principal citizens, attended.
On his arrival at Government House the bells of St. Paul's and the
old Mather Meeting House rang out a merry peal, and a large
number of the inhabitants crowded around to bid him welcome
again to Halifax. In the evening, bonfires were lit on the Grand
Parade in honor of his arrival. The Duke soon after removed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
his villa on the Basin, six miles from town. This beautiful little
retreat had been erected by Prince Edward on the land of the
Governor, Sir John Wentworth. The grounds were laid out and
improved at considerable expense under his direction. The
Rotunda, or music room, on the opposite side of the road, next the
water, surrounded by the rich foliage of the beech groves, and
surmounted by a large gilded ball, flashing in the sunlight,
presented a beautiful and picturesque appearance on the approach
to the Lodge. The villa was built altogether of wood, consisting of
a centre of two stories containing the hall and staircase, with a flat
roof. There were two wings containing the Duke's apartments.
In the rear was a narrow wooden building with pointed gothic
windows, resembling a chapel, containing the kitchen and offices,
which extended some distance southward beyond the main building.
The grouping of the beech and birch trees in the lawn and around
the house was well arranged. They were the original forest trees,
selected and permitted to stand in clearing away the space for the
buildings. The rooms were not spacious, and the ceilings low,
which appears to have been the fashion of building in Halifax at
the time. The woods around were very beautiful. They were
traversed by walks, and in several places by a carriage road with
vistas and resting places where little wooden seats and several
imitation Chinese temples were erected. Several of these small
summer houses were in existence in 1828, and probably later, and
portions of them could be seen through the openings in the trees on
passing the main road. The Duke erected a range of low buildings
on the edge of the Basin, a little to the north of the Rotunda, which
were occupied by two companies of his regiment, and contained the
guard room and a mess room for the officers. This building was
afterwards known as the Rockingham Inn, a favourite resort in
summer, when tea and ginger beer were to be had under the piazza
which ran along the edge of the water. This hotel acquired the
name of the "Rockingham," having been for a long time after the
Prince's departure the place of meeting of the Rockingham Club.
This club was established either while the Duke was resident here,
or very soon after his leaving for Canada. It was composed of
Governor Wentworth, the members of His Majesty's Council, the
Admiral of the station, several of the principal military officers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
a number of the leading citizens of Halifax. Dr. Stanser, rector
of St. Paul's, was one of its members; also the Hon. Andrew
Belcher, both of whom had villas on the Basin, the former at
Sherwood, afterwards the property of the late Mr. Thos. Kenny,
and the latter at Birch Cove, now in the occupation of the family of
the late Peter Donaldson.</p>

<p>The Rockingham Club was partly literary and partly social.
The members dined together at the hotel, which was styled the
Rockingham House, in compliment to Sir John Wentworth, the
head of whose family, the Marquis of Rockingham, was about that
time in, or at the head of the British Ministry. The large room
which extended along the south wing of the building, east and west,
with the end to the water, was hung with the portraits of many of
the members of the club painted by Field, a portrait painter of
considerable talent who, at that time and for several years after,
resided in Halifax, and from whose brush the portraits of many of
the then principal citizens and their ladies still remain.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In 1799 the prices of provisions in Halifax markets were as
follows: Beef, by the quarter, from 4d. to 5d. per pound, pork,
6d., mutton, 7d. to 8d., veal, 8d. to 9d., fowls, from 3s. to 4s.,
oats, 2s. 6d. and 3s., butter, 1s. 3d. and 1s. 6d.</p>

<p>In 1798 the number of illegitimate children in the Halifax Poor
House was fourteen, in 1799, seventeen, and in 1800, fifteen. The
total cost of the establishment during the three years was £570 16s.
1d. Fines received at Halifax, 1798, £60; 1799 and 1800, £82 10s.
Fresh Water Bridge was renewed and completed in 1798.</p>

<p>In 1799 the Legislature made some amendments to the Act for
the erection of public buildings. The Commissioners appointed
by the Governor and Council were authorized to purchase land
for the site of a new Government House. The old House to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
be appropriated to the House of Assembly and Courts of Law.
The Commissioners were Messrs. Wallace, Cochran, Hartshorne,
and John Beckwith. The House of Assembly voted £10,500 for
the building, etc. The old Government House having been found
unfit for the accommodation of the Legislature, was sold and the
block of buildings known as Cochran's, before mentioned, was
leased this year for £300 per annum for the accommodation of the
Law Courts, the Legislature, and the public offices connected with
the Provincial Government. Commissioners were also appointed to
build a new market house for the butchers and for a vegetable
market. This was the wooden building which was removed during
the administration of Governor LeMarchant, to make way for the
present brick structure. A clerk of the market was appointed.
There being then no convenient accommodation for the vegetable
market, the country people were permitted to sell in the streets and
the square in front of the market house.</p>

<p>This has once more become the custom; the portion of the new
market appropriated to the country people having been lately taken
for city offices. The want of sufficient space in the central parts of
the town for the convenience of markets and the erection of public
buildings, has been always an impediment to the improvement and
embellishment of the city. The small dimensions of the lots as
originally laid out, being only forty feet by sixty, and the short
space between the streets, the narrow spaces allowed for the public
landings, and the small size of the water grants for the erection of
wharves in the old town, have been a continual drawback to the
convenience of trade and the progress of improvement in front of
the town. And it is a subject of regret that at the present day so
little attention is paid by the public authorities to the future welfare
of the city in respect to laying off building lots and streets by
private owners and speculators.</p>

<p>The regular packet between Halifax and Boston, the Schooner
Nancy, usually occupied three days in her trips. She was
commanded by Capt. J. Huxford. He was afterwards known in
Halifax as Crazy Huxford. He was on board the Shannon, frigate,
in the engagement with the American ship Chesapeake, and had been
wounded in the head, from which he never fully recovered. He was
one of the best pilots on the coast and was, until his death, a naval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
branch pilot attached to the Dockyard. When under the influence
of liquor he became frantic and was continually shouting through
the streets of the town without hat or coat. This poor old man
died about twenty-five or thirty years ago at a very advanced age.</p>

<p>In May the small pox made its appearance in the town and strict
quarantine regulations were enforced. Dr. Gschwint (pronounced
Swint) was appointed health officer.</p>

<p>The elections took place this autumn. Messrs. William Cochran
and John George Pyke were again returned. The former polled
104 votes and the latter 346. At this time the electors were
confined to freeholders only. The franchise was not altered till
about the year 1836. Mr. Cotnam Tonge, Edward Mortimer,
Messrs. Fulton and Morris were elected for the county. Only two
resident in the town succeeded, Tonge and Morris; Wallace,
Stewart and Hartshorne were rejected by the Pictou votes.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 11th August, attempts were made by persons
unknown to set fire to the Dockyard, Government house and the
engine house. The Governor and Council offered a large reward
for discovery. A night patrol of militia and inhabitants was
ordered out under the superintendence of the magistrates.</p>

<p>The Rev. Bernard Michael Houseal, minister of St. George's, in
the north suburbs, died on the 9th March, this year, in the seventy-second
year of his age. He was a native of the Duchy of Wurtemberg,
was educated at one of the German universities, and was
esteemed a good scholar and a pious minister of religion. He had
been chosen by the learned consistory of Stuttgart for the ministry
of the Lutheran Church, and embarked for America in 1752. After
being several years in the ministry he took charge of a congregation
of Germans in New York, and came with the Loyalists to Halifax
in 1783. He was buried in the old German burial ground attached
to his church in Brunswick Street, and his tombstone remains there.
Mr. Houseal was succeeded in the Church of St. George by the
Rev. George Wright, who was also principal of the Halifax Grammar
School and chaplain to the garrison. The Round Church, in
Brunswick Street, was at this time only in process of erection and
was not finished until the year 1811, or thereabouts.</p>

<p>On the 30th October, H. M. Ship Porcupine, Capt. Evans,
arrived from New Providence, having on board the Duke of Orleans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
and his two brothers, the Duke of Montpensier and Count Beaujolie,
attended by Count Montjoye. They had been waiting for a passage
to England and had proceeded here in the Porcupine in hope of
meeting with an opportunity of going to Europe. Finding no
immediate opportunity to England, they both took their passage in
a merchant ship for New York. Though considered as prisoners
on parole, they dined with the Governor, and paid a visit to the
Duke of Kent at the Lodge. They also attended a public ball at
Government House on the 17th November. The Duke of Orleans
was afterwards elected to the French throne as Louis Philippe, King
of the French, and eventually died in exile in England. After he
became king, on meeting with several persons from Nova Scotia,
he very kindly enquired after several gentlemen of Halifax by name
and spoke with much feeling of the kindness he experienced while
in Halifax. On arrival he was found to be in very straitened
circumstances and the Duke of Kent was believed to have given
him pecuniary assistance to enable the party to proceed on their
voyage.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>1800. At the commencement of the century Halifax presented
a prosperous condition. The population now approached 9,000.
Trade was brisk, and the place was enlivened by a large garrison
and the presence of a Prince of the Blood Royal. The harbor was
the resort of the fleet and was the principal station of the naval
commander. The war was at its height and the Prize Court in full
operation. Several privateers had been fitted out by the merchants
of the town and captures of French vessels were frequent, though
the trade of the port occasionally suffered from the French cruisers
on the coast. Among the captures from the enemy at the time, the
most remarkable was that of two prizes, one French and one Danish,
brought in by Captain William Pryor, commander of the Privateer
Nymph, of Halifax.</p>

<p>Several public buildings were commenced this spring. On the
5th June the Prince laid the corner stone of the Masonic Hall. His
Royal Highness was Grand Master of the Masons of Lower Canada,
and acted for the Hon. Richard Bulkeley, Grand Master of Nova
Scotia, when age and infirmities prevented him from attending. A
masonic procession was formed and the ceremony is said to have
been one of the finest which Halifax ever witnessed. The band of
the Prince's own regiment, the 7th Fusiliers, performed under the
direction of Mr. Selby, organist of St. Paul's, one of the craft.</p>

<p>On the 10th April, Sir John Wentworth laid the corner stone of
the Round Church (St. George's) in Brunswick Street. The
Legislature this session voted £500 towards its completion. The
land on which the church was erected had been purchased some time
previously by the Committee of Superintendence. The design is
said to have been the work of the late John Merrick and Mr. J.
Fliegar of the Surveyor General's department, and for some years
surveyor to Governor Wentworth while Surveyor General of Woods
and Forests in Nova Scotia. St. George's old church, then known
as the Dutch Church, was at this time occupied by the congregation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
of the north suburbs, many of whom were the descendants of the
first German settlers. Though always an independent congregation,
it had been considered part of the parish of St. Paul's, the whole
Township of Halifax having been originally included in that parish,
and it continued so until legally erected into a separate parish by
the name of St. George's parish, under the Act of the Legislature
passed for that purpose in 1827. The Rev. George Wright was at
this time minister of St. George's congregation. He had lately
succeeded Mr. Houseal, who was styled Missionary to the Germans.</p>

<p>A sum of money, as we have seen, had been voted by the
Legislature for the erection of a Government House. Much
discussion had arisen in the House of Assembly and with the
Executive authorities, the funds to be appropriated for
this purpose, and some difference of opinion existed regarding the
site for the building. It was finally arranged that it should be
placed in the field between Hollis and Pleasant Streets, to include
the site of the old hospital. The corner stone of this edifice was
laid by the Duke of Kent on the 11th of September. A procession
was formed which proceeded from the old Government House,
accompanied by a band of music, and the ceremony was concluded
by a prayer by the Rev. Doctor Robert Stanser, Rector of St.
Paul's. Isaac Hildrith was the architect, and John Henderson chief
mason. No building since erected in Halifax exceeds Government
House in neatness of design and solidity of workmanship. Some
of the old brick buildings now remaining in the city were erected by
Mr. Henderson.</p>

<p>The old market house was taken down this year and the new one
commenced. This old market occupied the site of the recent City
Court House. The new one was erected in the open space opposite
the King's wharf, where the new brick market house now stands.
It was a flat-roofed wooden building intended to accommodate the
butchers only. A pitched roof was afterwards put on this building.
There was a small green market built at the same time next the
north line of the fuel yard, which was afterwards removed. These
buildings were erected at the expense of Government, the sum of
£2,252 having been granted by the House of Assembly to be
appropriated to the erection of this new meat market, also to the
repair and extension of the market slip or public landing, and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
the fish-market, and, at the same time, £250 was voted to the heirs
of the late Joseph Gerrish who claimed some interest in a portion
of the old market house lot. A small piece of ground at the corner
of the military fuel yard, next to the new market house, was about
the same time purchased from Mr. Kidston who then occupied it for
weigh scales and other purposes. The Grand Jury refused to
accept the grant from the Crown of the old market house lot in the
way it had been drawn by the Secretary of the province. The
Council declined to make the alterations in the grant required, and
concluded that the old building and the lot should remain under the
control of the Commissioners of Public Markets, and ordered the
old buildings to be taken down and the ground leased.</p>

<p>In March the House of Assembly was in session. The elections
of Mr. Tonge for the County and Mr. Pyke for the Town were
declared void by the House in consequence of some defect in their
qualifications. On the 9th April following, the new election for the
town took place, and on the 14th, Andrew Belcher was returned by
a majority of 65 votes. Mr. Michael Wallace was returned for the
County. Mr. Tonge, having been also chosen by a country
constituency, fell back on the double return and retained his seat.
On the 12th March, the House attended at St. Paul's church in a
body, when the Rev. Dr. Stanser, then chaplain, preached before
them.</p>

<p>This summer His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent took his final
departure from Halifax. The usual addresses were presented by
the House of Assembly, His Majesty's Council and the people of
the Town. He embarked in H. M. Ship Assistance on the 3rd
August, and sailed on the 4th. His embarkation was attended with
full military ceremony, the troops lining the streets. His Royal
Highness, accompanied by the Governor and Council and the
principal Naval and Military Officers, proceeded on foot through the
avenue formed by the troops to the King's Wharf, whence he
reached the ship under salutes from the batteries, the artillery corps
and the ships of war. Several of the old inhabitants not many
years since recollected the scene, and could describe the feelings
evinced by the townspeople on the occasion. His tall commanding
figure in full military uniform, his hat surmounted by the lofty
white plume, then worn by the fusiliers, could be seen above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
heads of the surrounding crowd as he walked down the line with a
smile of recognition for his friends, on passing them, amidst the
plaudits of the crowd.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Though the Duke exhibited on all occasions
the most kind temper in civil life, and his manner and conversation
with those he liked almost amounted to familiarity, yet his sternness
in military affairs never forsook him. Eleven soldiers had been
sentenced to death for mutiny and desertion, and had been left by
the Duke for execution, which was carried into effect under his
orders a few days after he left our shores. On the 7th August,
those unfortunates were brought out on the Common, dressed in
white, with their coffins, accompanied by the Revd. George Wright,
the Garrison Chaplain, and Doctor Burke, the Roman Catholic
clergyman, in the presence of the whole garrison. Eight of them
were reprieved under the gallows, and the three who belonged to
the Newfoundland Regiment were hanged. Public feeling was
against the Duke in this affair. It was thought that on the eve of
his departure he should have granted a remission of the death
sentence, which, as General Commanding, he had power to do,
until the King's pleasure should be known. Three executions only
a day or two after his departure, produced a disagreeable impression
of His Royal Highness in the minds of the people of Halifax,
who had just taken leave of him with so much kind feeling.</p>

<p>The Quarter Sessions having authorized the establishment of a
military exercising ground on the north end of the Common, an act
for which they had no authority, laid the groundwork of much
dispute and controversy with subsequent military commanders, who
on several occasions later undertook to interfere with the City
authorities in beautifying and improving the Common.</p>

<p>The death of the Hon. Richard Bulkeley, late Secretary of the
Province, occurred this year; he was in his 83rd year. Mr. Bulkeley
came to Halifax as Aide-de-Camp to Governor Cornwallis in 1749,
and had twice administered the Government as Senior Councillor.
Also that of Anthony Henry, the King's printer. He published the
Royal Gazette at Halifax for about 40 years. John Howe was his
successor in the office of King's printer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
1801. Early this year it was proposed to establish a bank in
Halifax by means of a joint stock company whose capital was to be
£50,000 in shares of £100 each. A committee of management was
named consisting of Edward B. Brenton, William Forsyth, Foster
Hutchinson, Lawrence Hartshorne, James Forman, James Fraser
and Captain John Beckwith. They required a monopoly, which was
refused them by the House of Assembly, and the project fell through.</p>

<p>The winter of 1800-1801 had been very sickly. Smallpox had
made its appearance in town early in the autumn, and 182 persons
had died of it between September, 1800, and the month of February
following.</p>

<p>Several fires occurred during the winter. Sir John Wentworth's
stables at the lodge were burned down. The most disastrous fire
which had occurred in the town for many years took place on the
5th February, when the block fronting the old Government House
on Hollis Street was partially destroyed.</p>

<p>On the 13th February this year, the society known as the Sun
Fire Company was established at Halifax. It was, perhaps, the
first Fire Company ever instituted in the town. Those known as
the Ph&oelig;nix Fire Company, the Hand and Hand and the Heart and
Hand were of a subsequent date. The Sun Fire Company in the
year 1810, included most of the principal inhabitants of the town.
Their names will be found in the <a href="#APPENDICES">Appendix</a>.</p>

<p>1802. A considerable outlay of money appears to have been
made on the streets of the town about this time. The commissioners
appointed for this purpose were Charles Morris, J. G. Pyke,
Lawrence Hartshorne, Michael Wallace and William Lyons. The
expenditure this year on the streets amounted to £930, and in the
two succeeding years to £696 and £808. The sum of £500 had
been granted in 1801 towards the expense of paving some of the
streets; the remainder probably was raised by assessment.</p>

<p>The names of the town magistrates in 1802, were John Newton,
Custos, Jonathan Binney, Geo. W. Sherlock, J. G. Pyke, Dr.
Michael Head, W. Taylor, Stephen H. Binney, Jas. Gautier, Wm.
Cochran, Charles Morris, Junior, Daniel Wood, William Thompson,
Michael Wallace, Charles Hill, Richard Kidston, P. Marchington,
Jonathan Tremain, James Clarke, William Schwartz, Hibbert N.
Binney and John Bremner. These are the Magistrates for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
County of Halifax. They all appear to have been residents in the
town. Lewis M. Wilkins was Sheriff; John Newton and H. N.
Binney were joint Collectors of the Customs; Daniel Wood,
Inspector; John Cleveland, Collector of light duties; and John H.
Fliegar, Gauger. The Firewards of the town were Mr. Pyke, Mr.
Wallace, Mr. Hill, Mr. Cleveland, Mr. Clarke, William Millet,
Elias Marshall, Thomas Fillis, Andrew Liddell, John Fillis, Wm.
Lyons, Thomas Boggs, John Howe and Garret Miller.</p>

<p>The Royal Nova Scotia Regiment on being disbanded this year,
presented an address to Sir John Wentworth, their Colonel, in
August. The names of the officers of this Regiment were Lt. Cols.
Francis Kearney and Samuel V. Bayard,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Major Geo. Thesiger,

<p>Governor Wentworth directed his reply to this address from
"the Lodge."</p>

<p>The population of Halifax had again decreased towards the end
of the year 1802. The returns of the number of inhabitants in the
town and on the peninsula were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
There were 1000 dwelling houses in the town and peninsula. In
taking the census, the wards of the town were distinguished as
follows: North Barracks Ward, Pontac Ward, Market House Ward,
Governor's Ward, Meeting House Ward, South Barracks Ward,
South Suburbs and North Suburbs.</p>

<p>The sum of £8,900 had been expended by the Commissioners on
the building of Government House, and but the first story had been
completed. Much dissatisfaction was expressed in the House of
Assembly with the course pursued by the Commissioners. Belcher,
Hutchinson, Cochran and Beckwith had kept no minutes of their
proceedings. Wallace appears to have had the principal supervision.
He was censured by the House for having acted without
the concurrence of those associated with him, and for exceeding the
limits prescribed him by law. But his zeal and ability were
commended and no corrupt motives were attributed to him. In
1804 an additional sum of £2,500 was voted to complete the
building, a considerable sum having been voted and expended the
previous year.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Several fires occurred in June which were supposed to be the
work of incendiaries. It had been proved beyond all doubt that
buildings in several parts of the town had been set on fire. A
patrol of militia under Colonel Pyke was ordered to patrol the
streets from sunset to sunrise, and all suspected persons who could
not give a good account of themselves at night were ordered to be
arrested. A reward of £100 was offered for discovery, and several
arrests were made. A boy who confessed to having attempted to
set fire to the Dockyard was sent out of the province.</p>

<p>On the 2nd September the 97th regiment arrived in the harbor
and landed immediately at the King's Wharf. On the 14th the fleet
arrived from Jamaica under the command of Commodore Baynton,
consisting of the Cumberland, 74, Bellerophon, 74, Ganges, 74,
Vanguard, 74, Goliah, 74, Thesis, 74, Elephant, 74 and the
Pelican, Brig. The 7th regiment embarked shortly after, and the
town people presented a farewell address to Col. Layard and Lieut.-Col.
Edwards. In April the Governor and Council were prevailed
on to grant a press warrant to Capt. Bradley of the Cambrian for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
ten days in the town to enable him to fill up the number of his crew,
it being 50 short of its complement.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Burke was at this time Roman Catholic Vicar
General of Nova Scotia under the Bishop of Quebec; he afterwards
administered the Episcopal office in Halifax as Bishop of Zion.
Dr. Burke was a gentleman of education and highly esteemed in the
community.</p>

<p>The death of a very aged inhabitant, John Murphy, occurred this
year. He was 90 years of age, and had been one of the first settlers
of the town. He had acquired a large property in fields in the south
suburbs, where he kept a large number of cows, and for a great
many years supplied the principal inhabitants with milk and butter.
The fields extending northward from Smith's tan yard to the corner
house formerly occupied by the late Sheriff Sawyer, were known
formerly as Murphy's fields.</p>

<p>1803. The following is an account of the butchers' meat sold in
the Halifax market for six months commencing July 1st and ending
December 31st, 1802.</p>

<p>The above is exclusive of the meat issued under contract for the
Navy, but it is to be assumed it included the Army contract.</p>

<p>1804. This spring the House of Assembly recommended that
the old market house should be taken down and a new building
erected on the ground for the purpose of a County Court House and
police office. This was the brick building lately used for city
purposes. An Act was passed in 1804 with that object.</p>

<p>The trade of the port was much depressed this season by the
number of captures made by the enemy, and from the low prices
obtained for fish in the West India market, where the merchants of
Halifax were undersold by U. S. fishermen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
Among the events of the year was the arrival of several
distinguished prisoners, among whom was General Brunet and
suite, who put into Halifax on their way to England, having been
made prisoners at St. Domingo. Governor Wentworth assigned
them the old Rockingham Inn, near the Prince's Lodge on the
Basin, as a place of abode while here. They were shortly after
removed to England.</p>

<p>In the autumn General Boyer, commandant of the garrison,
undertook to try the metal of the Haligonians by causing a false
alarm of invasion. The report was spread early in the morning
that the French were off the harbor. Before 10 o'clock, A.M.,
about 1,000 militia men were embodied and at their respective
posts. Two hundred of them were artillery men. The dress
companies were all in uniform and fully equipped. Among the first
who appeared on the parade ground with their guns were Parson
Wright, head master of the grammar school, and the Solicitor
General, James Stewart, better known as Judge Stewart.</p>

<p>1805. Press warrants were granted by the Council on the 6th
May to Vice Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell, then in command of the
station, for fourteen days. He afterwards demanded an extension
of his warrant for six months, which was refused by the Council at
their meeting on the 18th. In their reply to the Admiral they
mention that the number of seamen engaged in the West India
trade, etc., had been so reduced by captures, imprisonment and
other causes that there were not sufficient in the port to man the
vessels, and that all the seamen to be found in the town would not
now be enough to meet half the demand for one sloop-of-war in the
fleet. Moreover, that there were many at the time in French prisons
whose families were supported by charity in the town. This,
together with the high rate of wages in the United States, had
reduced the commerce of the port to the greatest necessity.
Finally, that the execution of impress warrants on shore were
attended with much disturbance and annoyance to the laboring
poor and others not fit for service, and the Council were of opinion
that it should only be resorted to on the most urgent occasions
and when advantage from it was to be reasonably looked for.</p>

<p>Mitchell, finding he could not prevail on the Council, undertook,
in the following October, to send press gangs through the town<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
without warrant. An armed party of sailors and marines from the
Cleopatra, frigate, under the command of one or more officers, were
sent out. The citizens resisted and a riot ensued, which resulted in
the death of one person and the wounding of several others. One
of these encounters occurred in the store of Messrs. Forsyth &amp; Co.,
where a number of merchant sailors had secreted themselves.
General Wentworth called a meeting of the Council on 23rd
November, and it was ordered that the Solicitor-General should
proceed to prosecute all persons belonging to the ships war who
had been engaged in impressments. The Attorney General, R. J.
Uniacke, Mitchell's father-in-law, was in England at the time, on
leave of absence. The Admiral's gang had broken open the store
of Forsyth &amp; Co. under the pretense of looking for deserters, and
Sir Andrew defended his conduct under the authority of a warrant
from the Admiralty, but he was condemned in heavy damages for
his illegal proceedings.</p>

<p>The town artillery at this time consisted of three companies
commanded by Captains Charles Morris, Bremner and Fillis, and
there was another under Capt. McIntosh of Spryfield, which did
duty at York Redoubt, composed principally of market fisherman
who were regularly trained to battery exercises. Governor Wentworth
appears to have been assiduous in his efforts to keep up the
local defences of the town, and to have placed much reliance on the
volunteer companies for that purpose.</p>

<p>There was a plentiful harvest this year throughout the whole
province. Provisions of all sorts were plentiful in the town, so
much so that the arrival of the fleet and a large export to Bermuda
and Newfoundland did not augment the prices. The importations
of flour from the United States, both this and the following year,
were very extensive.</p>

<p>In October an unfortunate French prisoner named Pierre Paulin
was executed on the common for the murder of a fellow prisoner.
The Governor and Council refused to reprieve him.</p>

<p>In December the town was illuminated and other joyful demonstrations
made by the inhabitants on the news of the Battle of
Trafalgar.</p>

<p>1806. In the month of February, Lieut.-General Gardner, the
commandant of the garrison, died at Halifax; his funeral was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
attended with much military pomp and ceremony. He was buried
under old St. Paul's Church.</p>

<p>A general election occurred in 1806, when Edward Mortimer
of Pictou, Simon B. Robie, S. G. W. Archibald and William
Lawson were returned for the county, and John George Pyke and
Foster Hutchinson for the town. Cochran, the old member,
petitioned against Lawson on the ground of qualification.</p>

<p>The Government House remained still unfinished. The sum of
£4,292 had been expended on the building since the last session,
which was £2,000 more than had been voted.</p>

<p>On the 29th April Halifax was thrown into alarm by the appearance
of a number of large vessels in the offing. Signal guns were
fired from the alarm posts in the harbor, and the military and militia
were under arms. There was another alarm of French invasion
on or about the 20th May, when several large vessels were again
reported off the harbor. The militia of the town were again
assembled, but the greater part of them were without arms.
Governor Wentworth had previously made several applications to
the Imperial Government for arms for the Halifax Militia, but it
does not appear that much attention was paid to his solicitations.</p>

<p>Among the advertisements which appeared in the Gazette this
year was notice of a periodical publication to be called the "Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick Magazine or Historical Library," which
was offered for sale at the book stores of Messrs. Morrison, Bennet,
Edmund Ward and William Minns. Morrison kept his book and
stationer's shop at the corner of Duke and Granville Streets, afterwards
known as Joseph Robinson's hat store, now owned by Mr.
Kiezer. He was succeeded in his business by George Eaton, who
was the principal book seller and stationer in the town for several
years. This old building, with others along the upper side of Granville
Street was destroyed by fire about 1827. At this time there was
a law in existence to prevent persons building wooden houses in the
town above a certain height. The present wooden building at the
corner was then erected under this law and did not exceed what by
measurement was deemed one story and a half. Several stone and
brick buildings were erected in consequence of this law. That to
the south of Kiezer's corner occupied by Mr. Simonds and others,
another in the same block built by the late William Macara,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
druggist, and the large double three story stone building in
Barrington Street, nearly opposite St. Paul's, were all erected about
this time by Mr. Matthew Richardson on the site of the late
Andrew Belcher's garden. Several old gamble roofed houses, the
remnant of the first settlement, were destroyed by the above-mentioned
fire.</p>

<p>On 22nd December, the American Government laid an embargo
on all vessels within American ports bound to any foreign places,
and the officers of the Customs throughout the States were directed
to refuse clearances to all such vessels. This was a great check to
trade, and Halifax felt the result in the scarcity of provisions and
particularly of flour, which went up immediately to £5 per bbl.,
the inhabitants having been in a great measure dependent on the
States for that article.</p>

<p>A sailor named John Wilson had been taken from the American
Frigate Chesapeake on charges of mutiny and desertion. He was
tried in Halifax by Court Martial on board the Flag Ship Belleisle
on 26th August, condemned and executed 31st. Two other
seamen were in October following executed on board the Jason,
Capt. Cochran, for mutiny.</p>

<hr />

<p>On 11th May, 1807, it having been reported to His Majesty's
Council that the Grand Jury and Sessions had refused to accept a
grant of the piece of land on which the old Market House stood,
upon the conditions which had been inserted in the grant, (probably
on it being vested in Commissioners) the Governor and Council
refused to alter the grant, and if not accepted by the Session it was
ordered that the old building be taken down and the ground cleared
and remain under the control of the Commissioners of Public
Markets. This was the site on which the late City Court House was
afterwards erected.</p>

<p>1808. In the month of April, 1808, the new Governor, Sir
George Provost, arrived to take the place of Sir John Wentworth,
who was allowed a retiring pension of £500 per annum. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
brought with him the 7th, the 8th and the 23rd Regiments, consisting
of about 3000 men, with Brigadier General Houghton. The
Governor came in H. M. Ship Penelope. At six o'clock on the
same evening of his arrival, he landed at the King's Wharf under a
salute from the Batteries. Sir John Wentworth was at his villa on
the Basin&mdash;the Prince's Lodge as it was called&mdash;when his
successor arrived, and did not receive the official letter announcing
his appointment until 18 days after the arrival of Sir George
Provost. On the 13th April, Sir John came to town and the new
Governor was sworn into office.</p>

<p>It was deemed advisable that some trusty person should be sent
to the United States to obtain information as to warlike preparations
then progressing in that country. Mr. John Howe, the
postmaster at Halifax, was chosen. He proceeded to Boston and
afterwards visited other parts of the Union. Mr. Howe was again
dispatched on a second mission late in the fall, and on his return
made a report to the Lieutenant Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Hood George, afterwards Sir Samuel, came out with
Sir George Provost. He was appointed Provincial Secretary, and
afterwards represented the County of Halifax in General Assembly.
He was the eldest son of Commodore Sir Denis George, who married
Miss Cochran of Halifax, and succeeded his father in the Baronetcy.
This young man died early of consumption, and was succeeded both
in the Baronetcy and the office of Secretary by his youngest brother
Sir Rupert D. George, who remained in office until responsible
government was established in the province.</p>

<p>The ships Milan, Observateur and Centurian were stationed at
Halifax during the winter. The Centurian was the ship in which
Lord Anson circumnavigated the globe. She remained in the
harbour as a receiving and store ship for many years, and was
broken up at the Dockyard somewhere between the years 1820
and 1823.</p>

<p>Among the visitors to Halifax this year was the notorious Aaron
Burr, late Vice President of the United States. He passed under
an assumed name.</p>

<p>1809. The winter of 1808-9 was remarkably severe. During
the month of February the cold continued so long that the great
expenditure of fuel was felt by all classes of the community. Much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
distress prevailed among the poor, and large sums of money were
raised by subscription for their relief.</p>

<p>An expedition had been fitted out at Halifax, under the command
of Sir George Provost, for the capture of the French Island of
Martinique. It was composed of the 7th, 8th and 23rd Regiments
with a Brigade of Artillery. Having succeeded in this enterprise
they returned to Halifax on the 15th April. The gentlemen of the
town gave a ball at Mason Hall in honor of their return. Three
soldiers of the 7th Fusiliers were the only men killed in the expedition,
the place having surrendered immediately on the attack being
made. A tablet to the memory of these three soldiers may be seen
in the gallery of the Round Church in Brunswick Street.</p>

<p>The Harbour was again this year the scene of another of those
Naval executions, which were performed with so much severity
during the time of war. A mutiny had occurred, or was supposed
to have occurred, on board the Columbine on the 1st August, off
St. Andrews. Four seamen and two marines were found guilty and
executed on the 18th September. They were afterwards hung in
chains on Meagher's Beach.</p>

<p>One of the most atrocious cases of piracy and murder on record
occurred this autumn on the coast to the eastward of Halifax. The
vessel was the Three Sisters, of Halifax, owned by Jonathan and
John Tremain, merchants of the town, commanded by Captain John
Stairs, brother of the late Honorable William Stairs, formerly
president of the Union Bank. She was on her way from Gaspé
Bay to Halifax with a cargo of fish. Edward Jordan, who had
been formerly owner of this vessel or in some way concerned with
her, took passage for himself and wife and four children with Capt.
Stairs for Halifax. The following account is taken from a Halifax
newspaper of 16th October, 1809:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Monday, October 16, 1809.</span>&mdash;The following are the particulars received
from Capt. Stairs, of the piracy and murder that took place on board the
schooner Three Sisters, belonging to this place, some account of which we
gave in our last.</p>

<p>"This most atrocious act of piracy and murder, of which none could be
guilty but the most diabolical incendiaries in human shape, took place, as
has been stated, on the 13th ult. off Cape Canso, on the coast of this
province, on board the schooner Three Sisters, bound and belonging to this
place from the Bay Cheleaur. Edward Jordan, who has been represented
as a passenger, and who had some interest in the vessel, appears to have
been the exciter of this act of barbarity. Jordan having corrupted the
mate, Kelly, who joined him in effecting his wicked intention, they secured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
the arms, and availing themselves of that moment most likely to assist
their horrid design, which was when Capt. Stairs was below with one of
his men,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> shot the other man who was on deck, and taking aim at Capt.
Stairs through the sky-light with a pistol, wounded him in the face and
shot the man who was near him in the breast. Capt. Stairs immediately
ran on deck, where he met Jordan with a pistol in one hand and an ax in
the other. Capt. Stairs then retreated into cabin and searched for his
pistols but found them taken from his chest with a sword; finding himself
destitute of arms he again ascended the deck and saw Jordan giving the
fatal blow to the man who was on the deck, when he turned from him
and presented another pistol at Capt. Stairs, which flashed when they
closed and the pistol in the struggle was thrown overboard. The man
who had received the wound below having reached the deck, made an
effort to assist his captain, but in his attempt, from weakness, fell on his
face, where he was shortly after dispatched with an ax by Jordan. In the
scuffle Capt. Stairs called upon his mate (Kelly) for assistance, whom he
perceived was in the act of loading another pistol, but who made him no
answer. At which time Jordan's wife, a fit companion for so base a
monster, attacked him with a boat hook which he parried with his arm,
and after much exertion disengaged himself, and seizing one of the
hatches, jumped into the sea. The wind blowing a strong breeze, the
vessel soon left him to his precarious fate, where he remained about three
hours, when he was taken up by the schooner Eliza Stoddard, of Hingham,
in an almost lifeless condition from wet and cold."</p></blockquote>

<p>The vessel was captured and brought into Halifax, and Jordan
and his wife placed on their trial before a special commission for
the trial of piracies on the high seas on 15th November. The
Commission of Judges who sat on this occasion were Lieut.-Gen'l
Sir Geo. Provost, Vice Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, Chief
Justice Blowers; Councillors, Butler, Wallace, Brenton, Hill,
Uniacke and Morris; Capt. Lloyd, R. N., Capt. Lord James
Townshend, R. N. and Capt. Simpson, R. N., Sir Samuel Hood
George, Provincial Secretary, T. N. Jeffery, the Collector of
Customs. Doctor Cooke, the Admiralty Judge, refused to attend
because the Commissioners would not allow him precedence of the
Governor with a veto on the proceedings of the Court. No jury
was called under this commission. Jordan was found guilty and
sentenced to be hanged, which sentence was carried into execution
on the beach some distance below Fresh Water Bridge, and the
body was afterwards gibbeted on the shore some distance further
down. The wife was acquitted, and a subscription was raised in the
town to send her to Ireland. Dr. Burke, the Roman Catholic
clergyman, Dr. Archd. Gray, minister of St. Matthew's, and Dr.
Stanser, Rector of St. Paul's, acted as a committee for the purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
The court assembled again a short time after, for the trial of the
mate, Kelly, who was convicted, but afterwards pardoned.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>This being the 50th year of the reign of King George III, a jubilee
was celebrated at Halifax on the 23rd October, with great ceremony.</p>

<p>The market slip, the new fish market and meat market were all
repaired and improved this year at the cost of £571, £500 of which
had been voted by the Assembly for the purpose. The taxes
gathered in the town for liquor licenses in 1809 amounted to £1400.</p>

<p>The Fire Insurance Association of Halifax was established on
24th April, 1809. The first directors were Andrew Belcher, Charles
Hill, Lawrence Hartshorne, Foster Hutchinson, James Fraser,
George Grassie and H. H. Cogswell. Mr. J. H. Fliegar was
secretary and the office was kept in his house in Hollis Street, where
it continued to be kept for a great many years. He was succeeded
by Mr. William Newton, at whose death Mr. Tremain was appointed.</p>

<p>Meetings of the Committee on Trade were held during the
autumn. The Halifax Marine Insurance Company first opened
their office for business in Water Street, opposite the fuel yard, this
year. The committee of management were George Grassie, Jesse
Woodward, Garret Miller, James Kerby, Lawrence Doyle, Lewis E.
Piers, John Osborne, Thomas Deblois and John Albro'.</p>

<p>Among the merchants of Halifax at this time we find, in addition
to the above, the names of Wm. Stairs, Wm. Bremner, Hartshorne
&amp; Boggs, at the old corner of George and Granville Streets,
Kidston, Dobson &amp; Co., Richard Kenefick, who had lately brought
out Irish linen goods, Forman &amp; Grassie, Shipping Merchants;
William Bowie, afterwards a partner of Stephen W. Deblois, and
who lost his life in a duel with the late Judge Richard Uniacke,
Alexander Izat, Dry Goods, at corner opposite two pumps, corner
of Hollis and Duke Streets, now occupied by the People's Bank;
Martin Gay Black, Dry Goods; Geo. N. Russell, afterwards
Wallace &amp; Russell, Hardware Merchant, corner of Hollis and
Prince Streets, now occupied by the Union Bank building; Temple
and Lewis E. Piers, Ship Chandlery. This firm several years later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
purchased the irregular shaped lot adjoining the City Court House
lately occupied by Stairs, Son &amp; Morrow, removed a range of one
story buildings or sheds known as the Ratstail, and erected a building
in which they carried on the ship chandlery business until the establishment
was purchased by Mr. William Stairs. Henry Austin,
afterwards a partner with William Stairs in ship chandlery, Water
Street, south of the fuel yard, and John Owen, shop keeper and
shipping merchant.</p>

<p>There was a small newspaper, quarto size, called the "Novator"
established or published at Halifax in 1809 by one James Bagnall
in Sackville Street. It was not of long continuance.</p>

<p>Jones Fawson was Sheriff of Halifax this year.</p>

<p>From the commencement of the year 1810 until the month of
April, 1812, there was a constant apprehension of a rupture with
the United States. The garrison and navy enlivened the town by
their frequent balls and festivities. The Rockingham Club, before
mentioned, continued to have their weekly dining on Saturday at
the old Rockingham Hotel on the Basin. It was then customary
for the merchants and other principal inhabitants, occasionally to
give public dinners to the generals, admirals and principal officers
of both army and navy. These dinners, as well as those of the
National Societies, were held at the old Mason Hall, that building
then containing the most spacious and convenient room in the city.</p>

<p>In January, 1811, the merchants of Halifax petitioned the
King, through the Lieutenant-Governor, to permit the coal mines
in Nova Scotia to be opened and worked under regulations. A
proposal was made this year for the formation of a Joint Stock
Bank. The books for subscription were opened at the office of
Henry Yeomans, insurance broker, and were first signed on 13th
February by the Committee of Trade, consisting of William Sabatier,
Andrew Belcher, John Black, James Fraser, George Grassie, Charles
R. Prescott and John Pryor. No further proceeding appears to
have been taken towards this object.</p>

<p>Much suffering as usual among the poor prevailed this winter. A
society for the relief of the poor had been formed, which distributed
during the year ending 9th February, 1811:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span></p>

<p>Eighty-four persons in distress, with their families, and others,
in Halifax, Preston, Dartmouth, Chezzetcook, Windsor Road and
Lawrencetown, with several families in Digby and Shelburne, were
relieved at the time from the same funds.</p>

<p>The committee in charge of this fund and its distribution were
Edwd. B. Brenton, Revd. Robert Stanser, Revd. Archibald Gray,
W. J. Almon, M. D., Hibbert N. Binney, John Lawson, Treasurer.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the 19th February, a public fast was proclaimed
throughout the Province, which was observed at Halifax, with due
solemnity.</p>

<p>Two fires occurred this year, one at Commissary Buildings on
Hollis Street, the spot on which the Bank of Nova Scotia stands, on
18th April, and the other at Bellemont, Mr. John Howe's residence
at the North West Arm, on 6th May. Both buildings were saved.</p>

<p>The office of the Nova Scotia Marine Insurance Company was
kept by Henry Yeomans, broker, of the Company. A new Marine
Insurance Office had been started in February; George Grassie was
Chairman of the Committee of Management, and John Bonnett was
Secretary.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">The Province Building.</h3>

<p>Decisive measures were adopted this session by the Legislature for
the erection of a building for the accommodation of the legislative
bodies, the courts of law and the public offices, on the site of
the old Government House on Hollis Street. Commissioners
were appointed and plans and elevations prepared or procured by
Mr. John Merrick. Chief Justice Blowers, Mr. Speaker Wilkins
and Judge Hutchinson has the planning of the interior arrangements,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
and George Grassie, Winkworth Allen and John Merrick were the
commissioners to erect the building. Mr. Richard Scott was
the builder employed to conduct the work. The building was fully
completed and finished, ready for the sittings of the Courts and
Legislature, in 1820, at the cost of £52,000.</p>

<p>A new steeple and an addition of 16 feet to the northern end was
added to old St. Paul's Church this year, at the cost of £1000,
granted by Government, £500 from a fund known as the Militia
Arms Fund, and the remainder from funds arising out of the forfeited
estate of one Jonathan Clarke. Hibbert N. Binney and H. H.
Cogswell were the churchwardens. Their advertizement for tenders
for the work appears in the Gazette. The sum of £500 from the Arms
Fund was at the same time granted to St. George's Church towards
finishing the interior of that building. These works were commenced
this year, but were not finished until late in 1812. But one capital
criminal conviction is recorded in 1811, that of one Sarah Wilson
for burglary. She was sentenced to death, but afterwards reprieved.</p>

<p>On the 27th May the sloop of war, Little Belt, Capt. Bingham,
arrived from a cruise. She reported having fallen in with the
United States frigate, President, by whom she was fired into, and
had sixteen men killed and twenty-one wounded, and the rigging of
the ship much cut up. The two nations being at peace at the time,
the affair caused much excitement in Halifax. Explanations were
offered on the part of the Captain and Officers of the U. S. frigate,
which only tended to show the bitterness of feeling which shortly
afterwards manifested itself in open hostilities. Early this season
non-intercourse was established between the United States and Great
Britain.</p>

<p>Sir George Provost was now appointed to the chief command in
Canada. The inhabitants of Halifax presented a congratulatory
address on his promotion on the 19th August. He sailed for
Quebec on the 25th, and Sir John Cope Sherbroke, his successor,
arrived with his family from England on 16th October following in
the ship Manilla.</p>

<p>On 26th September a poll was opened by Capt. Jones Fawson,
then Sheriff, for the election of two members for the town and four
for the county. John Pryor, John Geo. Pyke and William H.
Taylor were nominated; the latter retired and the two first were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
declared elected. The four old members for the county were
returned. Mr. William Sabatier was nominated but afterwards
retired from the contest.</p>

<p>The merchants of Halifax, on 20th July, petitioned the Governor
respecting the state of trade, etc., stating that they were agreed to
take gold and silver coins at the following values, viz: A Guinea,
£1 3 4, Halifax currency; a Johannes, at £4; a Doubloon, at
£3 17 6; an Eagle, at £2 10; the old French Guinea, at £1 2, and
all the other decimal parts of the same coins at a proportional
value; English and old French Crowns, at 5s. 6d; Spanish Dollars,
(including those which heretofore passed current at 4s.) at the rate
of 5s. At this time British silver was unknown at Halifax&mdash;Spanish
silver was the current coin. It came up from the West
Indies and Spanish America in the course of trade, and the British
Government found it more convenient for various reasons to pay
their troops stationed here in Spanish silver than to import British
coin for that purpose.</p>

<p>The names attached to this petition were William Bowie, Garret
Miller, Starr &amp; Shannon, Charles Loveland, Moody &amp; Sinclair,
Alexander McDonald, William A. Black, Martin Gay Black, John
Albro, Charles Boggs, Henry Ford &amp; Co., Henry Austin, Michael
Forrestall, Jonathan and John Tremaine, John W. Pyke, Matthew
Richardson, Richard Tremain, Samuel Head, M. D., Kidston,
Dobson &amp; Telford, H. Taylor, John Liddell &amp; Co., Capel Hines,
Jas. Ewing, George W. Mitchell, Prescott Lawson &amp; Co., James
Fraser, Winkworth Allen, Smith &amp; Thom, Scaiffe &amp; Baine, R. Lyon,
Sr., Andrew Belcher, Forsyth, Black &amp; Co., Lawrence Hartshorne,
Charles Hill, Forman Grassie &amp; Co., John Lawson, James Leaver,
William Minns, John Osborne and John Owen.</p>

<p>A proposition concerning some alteration in Water Street, near
the Ordnance Yard, was made by Captain Gustavos Nichols of the
Royal Engineers. It was understood that the town would not agree
to the proposal unless the Military authorities surrendered a road
in continuation of Hollis Street, southward. The subject had been
mooted for a long period previous to this time, but no arrangement
could be agreed on between the military and the town authorities.
Captain Nichols' letter makes an offer according to the plans therein
enclosed. This letter and plans are not now forthcoming among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
the City or Provincial Records, and therefore the particulars of the
proposition made by the Engineer Department cannot now be
understood. Copies of these plans may possibly exist at the
Lumber Yard and Engineers' office.</p>

<p>On the 17th March, the Irish Society celebrated the anniversary
of St. Patrick this year by a dinner at Mason Hall, which was
attended by the Governor, General Balfour, Commissioner Inglefield,
Judge Croke, the Captains of the Navy in port and the Staff
of the Garrison, etc. The Hon. Charles Morris was President,
and Samuel Hood George, afterwards Sir Samuel, was Vice. The
dinner was at five o'clock, the fashionable hour in those days. The
Governor and principal guests retired at nine. The rest of the
company sat late, but the utmost harmony and good feeling
prevailed. These national festivals were better attended in those
days, when no political animosities existed to disturb the harmony of
the good people of Halifax.</p>

<p>On the 11th May, there was a public examination of the Halifax
Grammar School under old parson Wright&mdash;a ceremony in which
the inhabitants at this period took much interest. On this occasion
Mr. Edward Monk, son of Judge Monk, took the first prize; Lewis
M. Wilkins, the late Judge, won the second, and the third was
given to James Bailey, and the fourth to Edward Fairbanks, a
brother of S. P. Fairbanks, Esq., and of the late Judge Charles R.
Fairbanks, Master of the Rolls.</p>

<p>A Company was formed this year, in Halifax, for prosecuting the
codfishery. The managers were John Lawson, Henry H. Cogswell,
William Pryor, Garret Miller, John Brown, John William Morris
and Charles Loveland. A large capital was raised in shares of
£50 each.</p>

<p>On the 20th November, the fleet sailed for Bermuda, consisting
of the Flag Ship of Admiral Sawyer, the Spartan and Melampus,
Frigates; the Atalanta, Ratler and Indian, Sloops-of-War.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the year the following Ships of War,
under the command of Sir John Borlase Warren, were on this
station, viz.: Swiftsure, 74; Guerriere, 40; Melampus, 36;
Æolus, 39; Cleopatra, 32; Euridice, 24; Little Belt, 22; Halifax,
18<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; Indian, 18; Emulous, 18; Atalanta, 18; Colibre, 18; La<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
Fantome, 18; Plumper, 12 and the schooners Vesta, Juniper, Holly,
Barbare, Bream, Cuttle and Chub. The old Centurian was the
receiving ship; she remained for many years off the dockyard. The
Pyramus was afterwards used as a receiving ship for the fleet lately
sold and broken up; she was an old-class 50 taken from the Danes
at the capture of Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The Eighth and Ninety-eighth British regiments, the Nova Scotia
Fencible Infantry, with a battery of Artillery and a company of
Engineers composed the Garrison of Halifax. Captain Philip Van
Cortlandt was Town Major, and Stephen Hall Binney, Barrack-master.
The former was succeeded by Lieutenant John McColla as
Town Major, who resided in Halifax for a number of years, and
was Adjutant General of the Provincial Militia. Major-General
Balfour<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> commanded the Garrison. Captain J. N. Inglefield,
R. N.,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> was Commissioner of the Dockyard, and Mr. P. F. Wallis,
first clerk. Mr. W. was father of Admiral Sir Provo Wallis, who
distinguished himself in the action of the Shannon and Chesapeake.</p>

<p>A Marine Humane Society existed at Halifax in 1811. Their
drags, for the recovery of drowned persons, were advertised as
being lodged in the respective stores of Hon. And. Belcher, John
Pryor, John Brown, Samuel Muirhead and John Starr.</p>

<p>The 30th September was marked by a severe gale of wind from
the S. E., by which many of the wharves in the town were ripped
up and much damage done to the shipping in the harbour and along
the coast.</p>

<p>The year terminated by a proclamation opening the Port of
Halifax to vessels of neutrals. The proclamation bears date the
24th December.</p>

<p>Among the deaths recorded this year was that of James Gautier,
Esq., for many years clerk of His Majesty's Council and keeper of
the public records in the Secretary's office. He died poor. The
Legislature voted £30 to defray the expenses of his funeral. He
left no family.</p>

<p>The principal retail merchants in the town at this time were
Martin Gay Black, Smith &amp; Thom, Carret &amp; Alfort at the corner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
lately occupied by Messrs. Duffus; John Liddell &amp; Co., H. Ford,
McDonald &amp; Co., Robert Lyon, W. Bremner, John Lawson,
Kidston, Dobson &amp; Telford, Scaiffe &amp; Bain, Thomas Heaviside,
James Fraser, Arthur Brymer, all Dry Goods&mdash;Moody &amp; Sinclair,
C. &amp; R. Hill &amp; Co., Red store, road leading to Dockyard, Thomas
Leaver and William Remmington, all Auctioneers, William Minns
and Geo. Eaton, Stationers. Mr. Minns occupied the old building
in Barrington Street below the Parade, opposite Dalhousie College,
where he died about 1825. He conducted a paper called the
Weekly Chronicle for above 20 years. Windham Madden and
William Conroy kept Livery Stables.</p>

<p>1812. Orders had been issued early this season to put the Forts
in repair; the works on the Citadel Hill having again fallen into a
dilapidated condition. Captain Nichols, commanding the Royal
Engineers, made an elaborate report, and operations were commenced
forthwith under his superintendence. The United States
had now declared war. Commodore Rogers, in command of an
American Squadron, had fallen in with the British Frigate Belvidere,
36 guns. She sustained the attack for two or three hours and at
length got off with the loss of several of her crew killed, the Captain
and 22 wounded. The Belvidere came into the harbor on the 27th
June, and on the following evening a special dispatch arrived from
the Governor of New Brunswick with intelligence of the Declaration
of War. Sir John immediately made the necessary arrangements
for calling out the militia. All able-bodied men between 18 and 50
were to be billetted for service and a portion of them to be immediately
embodied. This was arranged by Order in Council dated
28th June. The Belvidere, after she had escaped from the
American Squadron, captured three American merchant vessels
which she brought in with her. Halifax being the headquarters of
the Naval force under Admiral Warren, who had upwards of 60
pendants under his command, prizes now began to be brought into
port. The Court of Admiralty under Judge Croke was in active
operation, and the newspapers of the day appear filled with advertizements
of sales of prizes and prize goods. Cartels frequently
came and went between Halifax and the American ports for the
exchange of prisoners. With all this bustle of business money
became plenty, and the foundations of small fortunes began to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
laid by the Crown lawyers and the prize agents. The presence of a
large army and navy caused much dissipation in the town. Festivities
of all kinds prevailed. Subscription assemblies at Mason Hall
were kept up during the winter under the management of Mr.
Jeffery, Collector of the Customs, Capt. Brenton, of the navy, and
Lieut.-Col. Robertson, of the garrison. Dinner parties at Government
House, and balls and levies on state days, with the frequent
rejoicings on the news from time to time of the success of the
British Armies, both in Europe and America, completed the round
of Halifax festivities.</p>

<p>The capture of the British ship Guerriere, a first class frigate
commanded by Capt. Dacres, belonging to the Halifax squadron,
by the Americans, in August, caused much talk and excitement
throughout the community. Capt. Dacres, a young and inexperienced
officer, it was thought had surrendered too early to the enemy.
He had only left the harbor a short time when he lost his ship.</p>

<p>In July, a press warrant was granted to Rear Admiral Sawyer
for 48 hours. Desertions from the navy were frequent and large
offers were reported to have been made by the enemy for such
able seamen as would come over to the American navy. The
Commander-in-Chief, in consequence, found it necessary to publish
a proclamation at Halifax offering the King's pardon to all who had
deserted, on their returning to their duty. Letters of Marque
against the Americans were ordered in Council on 31st July, and
all vessels were prohibited from leaving the port without special
license, for the space of one month.</p>

<p>The old Halifax Artillery Company was at this time a very
popular corps, and included many of the young merchants as well as
tradesmen of the town. It was at one time supposed that the
property owned by those whose names were on its roll comprised no
small part of the wealth of our town.</p>

<p>An Act of the Legislature was passed this year regarding that
part of the public road or highway which leads from Fort Massey
to the exercising ground on the Commons. His Majesty's service
required that this piece of road should be enclosed for the purpose
of enlarging the Artillery Park. It was therefore enacted that
when the officers of His Majesty's Ordnance should have laid out a
new road agreeable to the plan submitted to His Excellency Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
John Cope Sherbrooke, and filed in the Surveyor General's office,
measuring fifty feet in breadth, through the field of John George
Pyke, and shall have procured a release from Mr. Pyke, and shall
have completed said new road, that the Engineer should take in 310
feet in length of that part of said road which now leads from Fort
Massey to the exercising ground on the Common, forever for the
Ordnance Department at Halifax. The new road to be substituted
therefor.</p>

<p>1813. The arrival of DeWatteville's regiment of Germans in
May on their way to reinforce the army at Quebec, and of the
American ship Volante with a valuable cargo and mounting 21 guns
taken by H. M. Brig Curlew, Capt. Michael Head,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and the
accession of the 64th Regiment to the strength of the garrison were
the chief events during the spring of 1813.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, the 6th, June, the inhabitants of Halifax
were surprised by the arrival of His Majesty's Ship Shannon, Capt.
Broke, with her prize the United States Frigate Chesapeak, Capt.
Lawrence. The engagement which was said to be the result of a
challenge on the part of Capt. Broke, took place off Boston Harbor
a very short time after the Shannon left Halifax. The enemy
surrendered after about 20 minutes fighting. Capt. Broke ran his
ship in upon the Chesapeak, and captured her with his boarding
party who, "rushing upon the enemy's deck, carried away everything
before them with irresistible fury." Capt. Lawrence, and
his First Lieutenant, Ludlow, were killed; the latter died at Halifax
on the 13th June. The engagement was one of the most bloody on
record. The Shannon had 30 men killed and 57 wounded, and the
Chesapeak 74 killed and above 100 wounded, all within the short
space of little more than fifteen minutes. When the ships came up
the harbor the decks were being swabbed and the scuppers ran quite
red. Numbers of the inhabitants of the town put off in boats and
visited the ships. Though the bodies of the slain had been nearly
all removed from sight, yet the marks of the slaughter were terribly
conspicuous. Mr. Provo Wallis, a Halifax man, one of the Lieutenants
of the Shannon, brought in the prize. He received his
promotion as Commander soon after, and later became a full
Admiral and Knight Grand Cross of the Bath. On the 8th, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
funeral of Capt. Lawrence took place. The body was landed under
minute guns from the ships and the procession proceeded from the
King's Wharf to the old English Burial Ground attended by an
immense concourse of people. The coffin was covered by the
U. S. colours and six British Post Captains bore the pall. The
34th Regiment formed the firing party. The officers of the garrison,
His Majesty's Council, the principal civil officers and heads of
departments, and all the officers of the navy in port followed in
procession, the American officers walking next the coffin.</p>

<p>On the 10th August, following, an American Brig with a flag of
truce arrived for the bodies of Capt. Lawrence and Lieutenant
Ludlow, which were taken up and carried to their native country.
That of Capt. Lawrence lies in the yard of Trinity Church, Broadway,
New York, where his tomb is to be seen on the left of the
entrance.</p>

<p>A memorial of the merchants of Halifax, numerously signed, was
presented to the Colonial Secretary through the Governor, complaining
of the permission of American vessels to resort to the
British West Indies, and of the right of fishery conceded to the
Americans by the Treaty of 1783, and praying that the interests of
Nova Scotia might be considered in any future negotiations. Among
the principal signers were William Sabatier, John Black, John
Pryor, Geo. Grassie and Enos Collins. At this time the English
Government was very jealous of British Colonial rights, and was
ready to fight in their defence.</p>

<p>The town and its vicinity had for the last two years abounded
with French prisoners of war. Those taken from American prizes
now increased the throng. A prison had been erected at Melville
Island, at the head of the North West Arm, for their accommodation,
and soon became crowded. Many of the French sailors
were ingenious workers in wood and bone, and made articles of use
as well as ornament, which they sold to the numerous visitors who
were freely permitted access to Melville Island. It was the favorite
resort of the young people on Sundays and holidays, where a
pleasant hour could be passed in conversing with the French prisoners
and examining their toys. The French naval officers were on
parole of honor, and resided in Dartmouth and Preston. They
spent their time chiefly in field sports, occasionally visiting Halifax,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
where they mixed freely in society. M. Danseville, the Governor
of St. Pierre and Miquelon, resided in the house near Preston lately
owned by the Hon. Michael Tobin, known as the Brook House,
where he entertained his friends with great politeness and hospitality.
Many of the French prisoners were permitted to come to town
and work for the inhabitants. A number of our own Halifax
people were at this time languishing in French prisons. The sum
of £130 sterling was subscribed in Halifax for their relief, and
remitted to England in the month of July of this year.</p>

<p>Great quantities of prize goods were sold at auction this year,
taken principally from American vessels. The American trade was
terribly cut up by the British cruisers. On one occasion we find
advertised for sale at public auction by order of the Court of Vice-Admiralty,
dated 19th March, twelve full-rigged ships, eight brigs,
seven schooners and ten or twelve small vessels, with their cargoes.</p>

<p>On 7th September, the merchants of Halifax petitioned the
Governor and Council for permission to export to the States
portions of the prize goods as being particularly adapted to the
American market. The following names, among others, appear
attached to this petition: John Lawson, Temple F. &amp; Lewis E.
Piers,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Jas. Forman, Samuel Head, M. D., Hartshorne, Boggs &amp;

William Annand, Matthew Richardson, William Phillips, James
Russell, Miles W. White, Smith &amp; Thom, John Brown, W. H.
Reynolds &amp; Co., Harding &amp; Hill, A. McDonald, Henry Ford,
Stephen W. DeBlois &amp; Co., Wm. Bremner, John Moody &amp; Co.,

&amp; Co., G. N. Russell, Jonathan &amp; John Tremain.</p>

<p>On the 7th September, Sir Borlase Warren with his fleet arrived
in Halifax Harbor in eight days from the Chesapeake. The fleet
consisted of the St. Domingo, 74 guns, Diadem, 64, Diomede, 50,
Junon, 38, Romulus, 36, Success, 32, Fox, 32, Nemesis, 28,
Loupcervier, 18, Mariner, 15, Highflyer, 10, and several transports.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
The following passage from Murdoch's history affords a lively
picture of the condition and aspect of Halifax at this period, drawn
no doubt, in some measure from his personal recollection:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The effects of the war upon the people of Halifax were very marked.
Our harbor had become the temporary home of the ships of war, and
the place where their prizes were brought and disposed of. Our youths
were eager to participate in the path that seemed to lead by a few steps
to honor, glory, and fortune; and indeed when it is borne in mind
that several Halifax lads rose to be admirals, we can hardly wonder at
the school-boys' desire to wear the white stripe on his collar, and the
ivory-handled dirk that indicated his authority to command men. The
little capital, then occupying a restricted space, became crowded. Trade
was active, prices rose. The fleet increasing, provisions were in great
demand, and this acted as a large bounty in favor of the agriculturist
and the fisherman. Rents of houses and buildings in the town were
doubled and trebled. A constant bustle existed in our chief streets,
cannon were forever noisy; it was a salute of a man-of-war entering or
leaving, practising with guns or celebrating something or somebody.
There is another side to this picture which must not be omitted. The
moral condition of the town had become dreadful in the extreme. Eight
or ten thousand soldiers, sailors, and prisoners of war let loose in a little
town of less than 10,000 inhabitants can well be imagined."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The upper streets were full of brothels; grog shops and dancing
houses were to be seen in almost every part of the town. A
portion of Grafton Street was known under the appellation of Hogg
Street from a house of ill-fame kept by a person of that name.
The upper street along the base of Citadel Hill between the north
and south barracks was known as "Knock him Down" Street in
consequence of the number of affrays and even murders committed
there. No person of any character ventured to reside there, nearly
all the buildings being occupied as brothels for the soldiers and
sailors. The streets of this part of the town presented continually
the disgusting sight of abandoned females of the lowest class in a
state of drunkenness, bare headed, without shoes, and in the most
filthy and abominable condition.</p>

<p>The Acadian School was this year established by Walter Bromley,
Esq., on the Lancaster system. It was intended chiefly for the
instruction of the poor. Mr. Bromley had been paymaster of the
23rd Fusiliers, and having retired from the army while that regiment
was in garrison at Halifax, devoted all the energy of his philanthropic
mind to the amelioration of the condition of the poor. He
first opened his school on 13th January, 1814 in the old building in
Argyle Street, then lately used as a theatre for amateur performers,
where he held Sunday school for poor children of all denominations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
and had a large class of blacks, both children and adults, to whom
he devoted particular attention. Many colored men and women
who afterwards became valuable servants, and some of whom
entered into business in Halifax, owed their success and subsequent
christian life to the exertions of Mr. Bromley. His labors to
improve the condition of the Mic-mac Indians will be remembered
by not a few individuals now living. His house was open to them
at all times, where those who were not addicted to the habitual use
of spirits were hospitably treated, clothed and furnished with means
of following their hunting and other occupations. This continued
until he left the country. The old play house having fallen into
decay, the present stone building was erected on its site in 1816
and apartments for Mr. Bromley were therein provided. A printing
press which had been established by him at the Acadian School
became the means of disseminating his views regarding education
throughout the province, and his little pamphlets, entitled Appeals
to the People of Great Britain on behalf of the Indians of Nova
Scotia, were very forcible and touching. The first edition of
T. C. Halliburton's history of Nova Scotia was issued from
Bromley's press in 1824. When Bromley left Halifax in 1828, the
poor lost a true friend and the Indians their chief patron.</p>

<p>Halifax was visited by a great gale of wind in the autumn of
1813. The Gazette of the 19th November says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"On Friday evening last, a most tremendous gale, or rather hurricane
from the south-east, rushed up the harbor with such destructive violence
as has not been witnessed since the tornado which happened in September,
1798. The lapse of little more than one short hour left but few
vessels at their anchors and of those scarcely one that had not sustained
material injury. Its utmost fury being felt about dead low water, less
damage was sustained by the wharves and stores than might otherwise
have been expected, but several shallops and small craft were sunk, and
many others wrecked and torn by the sea. H. M. Ships St. Domingo,
Hogue, Maidstone, two brigs and a schooner were driven on shore.
Fourteen other men of war, including small ones, suffered by vessels
being driven against them. The Barossa, Diadem and the old Centurian
suffered least. There were forty-six merchant vessels, transports and
prizes, all large vessels except about seventeen, stranded; most of them
having been got off again. Twenty-four, including store ships and transports,
suffered more or less injury, and a brig, a transport and one or two
sloops sank and were totally lost. Several schooners were sunk at
Prospect, and two large vessels were reported overset off the harbor. A
number of lives were lost during the gale, and many seamen badly hurt
on board the ships of war."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
Among the deaths recorded this year was that of James Creighton,
Esq.,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> in his 81st year. He was the son of one of the settlers who
came with Governor Cornwallis in 1749, and had acquired a large
property in the neighborhood of the town which was inherited by
his son who was the ancestor of the family of that name now in the
city. The fields in the north suburbs adjoining the common were
for many years known as Creighton's fields; long since laid off into
building lots, including the streets known as Maynard Street,
Creighton Street and Bauer Street, etc.</p>

<p>The death of Sir Samuel Hood George, Provincial Secretary of
the Province, took place this year in England, where he went for
the benefit of his health. He died of consumption in the 24th year
of his age.</p>

<p>In the month of January, 1813, a murder was committed on the
Market Wharf, which caused considerable excitement in the town.
About 7 o'clock on Monday evening, January 25th, five soldiers,
having had some dispute with the shallop men on the wharf,
attacked them with their bayonets and badly wounded four men,
Frederick and Henry Publicover, Cornelius Uhlman and George
Teele. The main guard from the King's Wharf being called out,
three of the soldiers were secured. Henry Publicover died of his
wounds and the Coroner's Jury brought in a verdict of wilful
murder against some persons unknown. One of those who had
been apprehended, a young soldier named Oliver Hart, was tried
and convicted of the murder at the Easter term of the Supreme
Court, but was afterwards pardoned by the Governor. Much
dissatisfaction existed in the community in consequence of the
termination of this affair.</p>

<p>In the month of March the crew of a Spanish schooner, the
Serifina, was brought into Halifax. They had killed six of their
fellow-sufferers upon the alleged necessity of saving their own lives
by subsisting on the flesh of those they killed. Investigations were
entered into, the result of which does not appear.</p>

<p>The Commissioners of Streets for the town were appointed on the
12th May. They consisted of James Forman, John Albro, Michael<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
Tobin, Frederick Major, James Fraser and John Allen. The three
former remained in office until about 1829 or 1830, when a new
system was inaugurated under the management of H. H. Cogswell
and others. Matthew Forrester was the Overseer and Superintendent
of Streets under the Commissioners for many years. The old
Commissioners, a short time before their retirement, undertook to
remove all obstructions to side paths; many old houses stood on
banks with cellar doors projecting into what was supposed to be
part of the street. Others again were approached by flights of
steps, all of which were removed to the detriment of many buildings
in the suburbs. At this time the town was adorned in many places
by ranges of trees in the sides of the streets. St. Paul's Church
was surrounded by large old willow trees; a range of fine old
willows extended from William Pryor's corner down the eastern
side of Hollis Street past the Lumber Yard Gate. A fine range of
willows of less dimensions also ran along that part of Argyle Street
between the late H. H. Cogswell's stone house and the residence of
the late R. J. Uniacke, since sold for a country market. Again in
Poplar Grove, and the old Grenadier fort house which stood on the
site of the present Trinity Chapel in Jacob Street, on both sides of
Brunswick Street, particularly on the east side, there were several
fine clusters of Lombardy poplar trees of gigantic size, several
being in front of the residence of James Kirby. There were also
some fine trees in other parts of the town. These were all cut
down without mercy by Mr. Forrester, under the directions of the
Commissioners before the year 1830, and the lower stairs of a number
of buildings were buried in levelling the streets. Albermarle and
Grafton Streets were at this time in a very rough condition, particularly
the former, where banks of earth and stones were to be seen
in the centre of the street, sufficient in some places to obstruct
carriages. These were removed by the new Commissioners.</p>

<p>The town was at this time supplied with water by public wells
and pumps in various parts of the town. A pump stood at the
north end of the Province Building Square, in George Street, known
as Black's pump; another at the south end of the square; another,
known as the White pump, stood in the centre of Prince Street,
where it is crossed by Albermarle Street; this was one of the last
to be removed. There were two known as the Sisters at the corner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
of Duke and Hollis Streets, near the site of the building occupied by
the People's Bank. There were four or five along the east side of
Brunswick Street, one at the foot of Cornwallis Street, and a
number in the south suburbs and other parts of the town; also two
in Barrington Street in front of the Parade.</p>

<p>1814. During the winter of 1813-14 some distress existed
among the poor in the upper streets. This part of the town was
chiefly occupied by people of the lower order, and in consequence of
the war had become a resort for soldiers and sailors. Barrack
Street, before mentioned, was known as "The Hill" and was as
well known through His Majesty's dominions for its evil reputation
as the worst haunts of Plymouth or Portsmouth in England.</p>

<p>On the 25th February a public fast was proclaimed by the
Governor, after which we do not find any further proclamations of
this kind for many years.</p>

<p>A press warrant was granted to Rear Admiral Griffiths on 28th
February, when many of the idle and worthless vagabonds of the
town were happily secured for His Majesty's service, where they
would be brought under wholesome restraint.</p>

<p>It had been arranged this spring that a residence for the Admiral
of the station should be erected. The British Parliament had
granted the sum of £3000 for this purpose, which being found
insufficient, the House of Assembly of this province voted £1500
towards its completion. A site was selected in the field between
the Naval Hospital grounds and Gottingen Street, and the present
building known as Admiralty House was commenced this year, but
not finished until some time after. Why the local funds of the
province should have been devoted to this purpose does not clearly
appear.</p>

<p>The arrival of the English packet on 21st May furnished news of
the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte and the entry of the allied armies
into Paris. It being Sunday, the event was celebrated all Monday
by a military review with salutes, and the whole town was illuminated
in the evening. A military band performed during the evening
on the flat roof of the old market house, long since removed to
make way for the present brick structure, and the streets were
crowded to a very late hour. The merchants and many of the
principal inhabitants met at the Exchange Coffee House and other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
places, where hot suppers were consumed in honor of the occasion.</p>

<p>Among the captures this year was that of the American privateer,
Snap Dragon, six guns and 70 men, brought in by H. M. Sloop,
Martin on 5th July, taken off Sambro Light, and on the 13th, the
United States Sloop Rattlesnake, 18 guns, by the Leander frigate,
taken near Shelburne Harbor. About the same time 340 British
prisoners were brought to Halifax in Cartels from Salem in Massachusetts.
The Rattlesnake was afterwards sold and fitted out as a
privateer by merchants in Liverpool, Queens County.</p>

<p>The British forces having captured Washington in August, 1814,
a large number of black slaves, of both sexes, from the plantations
along the Potomac and Chesapeake Rivers, who had deserted their
masters, took refuge on board the British men-of-war while they
laid in Chesapeake Bay. Sir George Cochran, the naval commander,
sent them on to Halifax, where many of them arrived in September,
following in a transport ship and the Brig Jasper. They were
afterwards located at Preston and Hammond's Plains. Many of
the domestic slaves remained in the town as servants, attaching
themselves to the inhabitants. Those who went to the country,
being unused to cold and hard labor, were unable even with the
assistance of the Government allowance to make their living; soon
became paupers and a burden to the community, a condition in
which their children and grand-children largely remain. At the
close of the war a quantity of American soldiers' uniforms, taken at
Castine, in Maine, were served out to the Chesapeake negroes.
Their grotesque appearance in the blue and yellow coats, occasionally
intermixed with the green and red facings of the corps called the
York Rangers, (at the peace disbanded in Halifax,) must be within
the recollection of many of our old inhabitants.</p>

<p>The grand event of this year for Halifax was the fitting out of
the expedition for the invasion of the State of Maine. This
expedition consisted of the 29th, 60th, 62nd and 98th British
Regiments, with artillery and some militia. The two brigades were
commanded by Major Goslin and Colonel Douglas; the whole being
under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir John Cope Sherbrooke.
Rear Admiral Griffiths commanded the squadron, which
was composed of 3 seventy-four gun ships, the Bulwark, Dragon
and the Spencer, with two brigs, a schooner and ten transports.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
Castine was taken on 1st September, and the town of Michias by
Lieut.-Col. Pilkington, on the 11th. Thus all the State or District
of Maine fell into the hands of the British as far west as the old
bounds of Acadia. This territory was originally part of Nova
Scotia, and at the peace of 1783 had been conceded to the Americans
through the ignorance and imbecility of Lord Gambier, who had
been intrusted by the British Ministry with the settlement of our
lines. The British Government was erroneously induced to relinquish
this conquest at the close of the war, a policy which has
deprived this Dominion of the fairest timber lands of New Brunswick,
and caused the loss of the most direct line of communication
between the Canadian provinces through British territory, a loss
which the whole expense incurred by the British Government during
the war could not now repay. Sir John, having left a garrison to
take care of his conquest, soon returned with his little army to
Halifax. Several Halifax merchants availed themselves of the
opening afforded to make money, sent agents with supplies of goods
to establish shops at Castine, etc. The British authorities collected
the Revenue of Maine while in occupation, which amounted to a
considerable sum of money. This fund was placed by the colonial
minister in the hands of the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia,
who appropriated it in various ways as he thought most for the
benefit of the country. It was from this fund that Dalhousie
College was afterwards built and endowed by the Earl of Dalhousie,
who succeeded Sir John Cope Sherbrooke in the government, the
Legislature of the Province having been induced to vote the sum of
£5,000 currency towards the same object.</p>

<p>In the autumn the small pox made its appearance in Dartmouth
and Preston and was very fatal among the Chesapeake negroes.</p>

<p>The old Rockingham Club, which in the days of Prince Edward
and Sir John Wentworth dined periodically at the Rockingham
Hotel on the Basin, had ceased to exist, but it appears to have
revived about this time under the name of the Wellington Club. A
dinner at the Rockingham by the Wellington Club was announced in
the papers of 26th August to take place on the 30th instant at half
past four o'clock. Five o'clock was the fashionable dinner hour.
The Governor's dinner cards of this date were all for that hour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
The old Rockingham was destroyed by fire nearly half a century
ago. It stood on the shore of the Basin, a short distance north of
the Rotunda. After the departure of the Prince it became a house
of entertainment, kept successively by Graves, Paine and others.
It was a favorite resort being a convenient distance from town.
The approach from the post road was by a carriage drive next to
the Rotunda, between two beech trees, from which hung suspended
a sign with the Wentworth Arms. When destroyed it was the
property of the estate of David Muirhead.</p>

<p>In September the body of General Ross, who had been killed
before Baltimore, was brought to Halifax for interment. He was
buried in the old English burial ground with all military honors.
No monument to his memory appears in St. Paul's Church.</p>

<p>On the 24th November, the Man-of-War Brig Fantome, 18 guns,
went on shore at Prospect. She soon went to pieces, as also a
schooner which accompanied her. No lives were lost.</p>

<p>The merchants presented several petitions to the Governor this
year relative to the trade of the port. The following names appear
appended to these petitions, among which we will find those of
many of our principal citizens whose faces were once familiar to
many now living:</p>

Halifax did a brisk trade during the period of the American
War. The following list of exports for the year 1813 is given by
Murdoch in one of his notes: Vessels, 412; Tons, 54,457; men,
2,868; Boards and Plank, 1,881,722 feet; Staves, 232,562; Dry
Fish, 82,059 quintals; Pickled Fish in tierces, 408; Barrels,
29,829; Smoked Herring in barrels, 142; Boxes, 6,425; Fish Oil,
49,668 gallons.</p>

<p>1815. The winter of 1814-15 was more severe than the previous
one. The small pox had broken out in the town and many persons
died of it. A number of the black refugee negroes had been, about
the month of May, after the removal of the prisoners, placed on
Melville Island. They were all vaccinated to prevent the spread of
the disease among them. They remained here for a short time until
they could be located in the country.</p>

<p>The treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States
was ratified in February 1815, and executed at Ghent on the 24th
December following. An immediate exchange of prisoners took
place after the ratification, and many seafaring men belonging to
Halifax, who had been confined in American prisons, were restored
to their homes. Peace was proclaimed at Halifax on 3rd March.
This spring an Act of the Legislature passed for establishing a
Bridewell or House of Correction in Halifax. It was placed under
the control of the sessions, and the old gamble-roofed building
formerly used as a poor house, then situated at the western end of
the space known as the old poor house grounds, was taken for
the purpose and fitted up with cells, etc., for the prisoners. This
building was taken down, having ceased to be used after the
erection of Rock Head Prison and the Provincial Penitentiary on the
North West Arm. It was one of the oldest buildings in the town
afterwards, and was in early days the residence of Mr. Wenman, the
keeper of the Asylum. When it was first built is uncertain, but
being situate within the lines of the old forts, was probably a
military residence of some sort during the first five or six years of
the settlement.</p>

<p>A regular police court was this summer established in the brick
Court House. John George Pyke, John Howe and John Liddell
were appointed police magistrates. Mr. Pyke had long been custos
of the county, and he and subsequently Mr. Liddell gave regular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
attendance at the office. Mr. Pyke was allowed eleven shillings
and eight pence per day, and had three police constables at his
command, with the additional assistance of Hawkins, a colored
gentleman, who dressed in an old military uniform with cap and
feathers, usually escorted the criminals to and from the workhouse,
and when occasion required inflicted his 39 lashes on juvenile
offenders at the old whipping post, which stood at the south-west
corner of the building opposite Messrs. Stairs' office&mdash;a system
of punishment less expensive than paying their board and lodging
for eight or ten weeks from the taxes of the citizens.</p>

<p>The Spring of 1815 was very backward. The Basin had been
frozen up all winter, and was not free from ice until the month of
June. On the first of June the harbor was full of ice so as for
an hour or two to impede the progress of the ferry boats. It was
partially collected from loose ice which came down the Narrows from
the Basin, and some drift ice which was brought in in the night
previously from the sea by the tide and southerly wind.</p>

<p>There were two ferries at this time. The upper ferry was
conducted by John Skerry, whose memory is still cherished by many,
both in Dartmouth and Halifax, as one of the most obliging and
civil men of his day. Skerry's wharf in Dartmouth was a short
distance south of the steam boat wharf. The other ferry was the
property of Mr. James Creighton, known as the Lower Ferry,
situate to the south of Mott's Factory. It was conducted for Mr.
Creighton by deputy and was afterwards held under lease by Joseph
Findlay, the last man who ran a ferry boat with sails and oars in
Halifax Harbor. These ferry boats were furnished with a lug sail
and two and sometimes four oars. They were large clumsy boats,
and occupied some thirty or forty minutes in making the passage
across the harbor. There were no regular trips at appointed hours.
When the boat arrived at either side the ferryman blew his horn
(a conch shell) and would not start again until he had a full freight
of passengers. The sound of the conch and the cry of "Over!
Over!" was the signal to go on board. The boats for both ferries
landed at the Market Slip at Halifax. An act of the Legislature
had been obtained this session to incorporate a Steamboat Company
with an exclusive privilege of the ferry between Halifax and
Dartmouth for 25 years. They could not succeed in getting up a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
company, steam navigation being then in its infancy, and in the
following year had the act amended to permit them to run a boat by
horses to be called the Teamboat. This boat consisted of two
boats or hulls united by a platform with a paddle between the boats.
The deck was surmounted by a round house which contained a large
cogwheel, arranged horizontally inside the round house, to which
were attached 8 or 9 horses harnessed to iron stanchions coming
down from the wheel. As the horses moved round, the wheel
turned a crank which moved the paddle. It required about twenty
minutes for this boat to reach Dartmouth from Halifax. It was
considered an immense improvement on the old ferry boat arrangement,
and the additional accommodation for cattle, carriages and
horses was a great boon to the country people as well as to the
citizens of Halifax, who heretofore had been compelled to employ
Skerry's scow when it was found necessary to carry cattle or
carriages from one side of the harbor to the other. The first trip of
the Teamboat was made on the 8th November, 1816. The
following year an outrage was committed which caused much excitement
and feeling in the town. All the eight horses in the boat were
stabbed by a young man named Hurst. No motive for this cruel
act could be assigned, drunkenness alone appearing to be the cause.
The culprit was tried for the offence and suffered a lengthy
imprisonment. Mr. Skerry kept up a contract with the Company
for several years, until all differences were arranged by his becoming
united with the Company, and after a short time old age and a small
fortune, accumulated by honest industry, removed him from the
scene of his labors. The teamboat after a year or two received an
addition to her speed by the erection of a mast in the centre of the
round house, on which was hoisted a square sail when the wind was
fair, and afterwards a topsail above, which gave her a most
picturesque appearance on the water. This addition considerably
facilitated her motion and relieved the horses from their hard labor.
As traffic increased several small paddle boats were added by the
Company, which received the appellation of Grinders. They had
paddles at the sides like a steamboat, which were moved by a crank
turned by two men. In 1818 the proprietors of the old ferries
petitioned the House of Assembly against the Teamboat Company
using these small boats as contrary to the privilege given them by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
the Act of Incorporation. It afterwards became a subject of
litigation until the question was put an end to by Mr. Skerry
becoming connected with the Company. Jos. Findlay continued to
run his old boats from the south or lower ferry until about the
year 1835.</p>

<p>On the 3rd August, the Man-of War Brig Vesta arrived from
England with the news of the Battle of Waterloo. The town was
illuminated in honor of the victory, and the inhabitants kept up their
rejoicings till a late hour in the evening. Preparations were made
for a public dinner on the occasion, which took place at Mason Hall
on the 15th. The Attorney General, R. J. Uniacke, took the chair
and James Forman was Vice-President. The committee of management
were Doctor William B. Almon, John Pyke, eldest son of old
John Geo. Pyke, the custos. David Shaw Clarke, G. Lewis and
John Howe, junior, John Albro, Thomas Heaviside, Edward
Alport, Joseph Allison and William Bowie were the Stewards.
Subscriptions had been opened throughout Great Britain and the
Colonies for the families of those soldiers who were killed and
wounded in the action. The Town of Halifax including the
garrison and public officers contributed the large sum of £3,800.</p>

<p>This year an Act of the Legislature passed for regulating the
appointment of Trustees and Master for the Grammar School of
Halifax. The first Act establishing this school bears date 1780.</p>

<p>The refugee Negroes brought to Halifax by Admiral Cockburn had
been in a great measure a burden upon the community. A
proposition was made this year by the British Government to
remove them to a warmer climate, but no steps appear to have been
taken to effect the object. Had this suggestion been carried out at
the time much suffering would have been spared to these poor
people, and the inhabitants of Halifax relieved from a burden.</p>

<p>On 26th February a resolution passed the House of Assembly
directing the commissioners of the poor to cause an account to be
taken of the number of black persons in the Town and the environs,
who were brought to this country from the United States of
America. The following return, dated March 6th, was signed by
Richard Tremaine, Chairman of the Committee:</p>

<p>The men and women with families were generally in need; none
appear to have been located at Hammonds Plains at this time.</p>

<p>James Archibald was tried for the murder of Captain Benjamin
Ellenwood of Liverpool, N. S., before Chief Justice Blowers, in
Easter term of the Supreme Court at Halifax this year. He was
convicted and executed soon after on the Common.</p>

<p>Another attempt to incorporate Halifax was now made. It
will be seen that in 1785 the merchants of the town suggested the
subject for the consideration of the Governor and Council, but they
disapproved of the measure; again in 1790, the Speaker of the
House of Assembly, in consequence of complaints regarding the
settlement of the poor and the necessity of a police force, etc., drew
up the following resolution, which was passed: "Resolved, that it
be recommended to this House to present a humble address to His
Excellency the Lieutenant Governor, to request that he will be
pleased to grant a charter to the Town of Halifax for incorporating
the same, and enabling the inhabitants thereof to make such
by-laws as shall be sufficient to regulate the police of said town."
No step, however, was taken by the Governor and Council relative
to this resolution.</p>

<p>The merchants of the town had a meeting on the subject in 1816,
which resulted in a definite proposition being made, in which all the
details of the proposed charter were fully set out in a pamphlet of
some length.</p>

<p>The following preface or introduction to this pamphlet affords a
sketch of the plan proposed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p>The following plan for regulating the municipal affairs of this town has
been drawn up in the form of a charter, as the clearest and best method to
express the extent of the proposed improvements. The objects have been
pointed out by a thorough investigation into the various modes of conducting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
the public business; which was entered into in consequence of a
presentment made by the Grand Jury to the Court of Quarter Sessions in
the December Term of 1812. The Court having appointed six different
investigating committees of the Magistrates to meet the various objects
contemplated by the grand Jury, their several reports combined clearly
prove the necessity of some reform; but as it would now become an
invidious as well as a useless task, to point out the <i>prevailing errors</i> of the
present practice, which are but too evident to admit of a doubt, the gentlemen
who have undertaken the task of sketching out the <i>means of improvement</i>,
have left it to the Public to compare the one with the other.</p>

<p>It will be perceived by a perusal of the following sheets, that the Charter
has but two leading objects&mdash;to establish regularity in business, and to
define and extend the powers of the Magistrates and Grand Jury (acting as
a Common Council) to the same limits as (and not a step beyond) the
powers granted to all corporations within the King's Dominions.</p>

<p>The only novelty introduced is that of preserving a gradual change of
the ruling members of the corporation, without incurring the unpleasant
duty of the electing system. This is done by the appointment of ten
magistrates to act as trustees, two of whom will go out and two others
come in annually, and the appointment of the Grand Jury of the existing
year, (or if it is preferred that of the last year, or a draft from the whole
list until it is gone through), to act as a Common Council.</p>

<p>By these means the whole of the leading members of the community
(likely to take an active part in the affairs of the town) will, in turn,
partake of the duties of a respectable office, and become intimate, and
thereby feel interested in its affairs. The various articles of consumption
and of commerce will be better inspected than they are at present; the
revenues will be regularly attended to, and every desirable improvement
in possession of other similar communities in His Majesty's Dominions
will in time, no doubt be adopted.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Charter have been selected and drawn up with the
utmost care to avoid objections by an attentive reference to the London,
Philadelphia, New York and New Brunswick Charters, and the East Company's
by-laws; and the whole is arranged and worded agreeably to the
most approved forms, in order to obviate any difficulties on the part of
Government, or from local partialities.</p>

<p>In debating the merits of the following pages, these three queries will
naturally occur to and guide every reflecting mind:</p>

<p>1st. Whether the present management requires any improvement?</p>

<p>2nd. If so&mdash;is this an effectual plan?</p>

<p>3rd. If not&mdash;what is better?</p>

<hr class="lalign" />

<p>N. B. When the terms of the Charter are agreed on and assented to by
His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor, it is proposed to apply to His
Excellency to grant it for a term of three or five years by way of trial;
during which period such amendments may be made to it as experience
shall point out to be necessary;&mdash;after which, if it proves acceptable to the
inhabitants, application may be made to renew it for another term of a few
years, for the purpose of improving it still further, as its deficiencies may
appear; then the Charter may be made perpetual if the inhabitants
approve of it. It will be necessary to have an Act of the General
Assembly to confirm the Charter when first granted, and on every renewal
of it.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
Mr. Sabatier and a few others were principally concerned in
endeavoring to forward the object, but the Governor and Council
appear to have been still influenced the belief that their own
supervision of local affairs was preferable and better suited to the
circumstances of the town at that time.</p>

<p>It will be seen that in the plan proposed the idea of a popular
election of members of the corporation was not even thought of
either by the Government or the people of the town.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>1816. Soon after the peace the prosperity of Halifax began to
wane. The price of provisions and all the necessaries of life, the
value of real estate and the high rents of houses in the town all
became more or less affected by the scarcity of money arising from
the withdrawal of the troops and navy and the sudden alterations in
trade. The reaction was not fully realized until about two years
after peace was proclaimed, when the rapid fall off in the value of
real estate and the sudden check given to commercial pursuits was
found to have reduced many speculators to poverty.</p>

<p>Sir John Cope Sherbrooke having been appointed Governor
General of Canada, the principal inhabitants of the town gave him
a farewell dinner on 25th June. It was presided over by Chief
Justice Blowers and the vice chair was occupied by Michael Wallace,
the treasurer of the province. An address, largely signed by the
inhabitants, was presented to the Governor on his departure. Sir
John had rendered himself very popular in Halifax by his affable
manners and his prompt and decisive way of treating all matters
brought to his notice by the citizens. He embarked at the King's
wharf on Thursday, 27th June, under a salute from the batteries
and the cheers of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The rough condition of the streets of the town at this period
rendered immediate and extensive improvements necessary. Those
in the least frequented parts of the town had been so much
neglected that in many places they were impassable from the
accumulation of rubbish and the broken condition of the wooden
platforms or bridges at the gutters and crossings. In many places
the streets were overgrown at each side with grass except in the centre.
Brunswick Street, though one of the principal highways of the
town, was overgrown at each side with grass. Many of the old
Dutch houses then still remaining in this street stood on banks a
few feet above the sidewalk and where there were no buildings rough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
stone walls or fences marked the line of the street. Water Street,
from the continual traffic and wear during the period of the war,
had been worn into holes and was in wet weather almost impassable
from the accumulation of mud, particularly between the Ordnance
Yard and the foot of Prince Street. The market square at this
time, as also that portion of Water Street between Collins' Wharf
and the King's Wharf, was much lower than at present. It was
found necessary to pave this portion of Water Street, which was
accordingly accomplished during the years 1816 and 1817. The
pavement, which was with round stones, extended from the
Ordnance to Black and Forsyth's Wharf, (later Mitchell's) at
the foot of Prince Street. The Provincial Legislature contributed
the sum of £1,200 towards the work, and the expense of flagging the
sidewalks was charged to the owners of property fronting on
the street. About the year 1835 this pavement had so sunk down
as to be no protection from the accumulation of mud. The lower
part of the market square bordering on Water Street and the way
leading to the market slip or public landing were raised about five
feet. Between 1820 and 1824 new Street Commissioners were
appointed. The Macadamizing system begun to be introduced and
extensive improvements in the way of levelling the streets and
filling up hollow places were proceeded with.</p>

<p>The Acadian School, conducted by Walter Bromley, had now
been under way for about three years. It was inspected on 31st
July. There were 400 children in attendance. On this occasion
Mr. Bromley stated that since the opening of the school in 1813,
eight hundred and ninety-three children had received instruction
there, and about one hundred apprentices and colored children in
the Sunday schools. The latter were under the special superintendence
of Mr. Bromley himself, who devoted all his leisure to the
instruction of the black children and others who could not attend
school throughout the week. The small sum of £200 was voted
annually by the Legislature in aid of this school. Subsequently a
grant of money was made by the Assembly to the National School,
which was about this time set on foot on the Madras system, under
the auspices of the Bishop and members of the Church of England
in Halifax, who had lately erected the large three-story building in
Argyle Street, opposite the parade, for the purpose. In 1818 this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
school had 117 children in attendance. The daily attendance at
these two schools exceeded 500, which was a large number considering
the extent of the population at this period.</p>

<p>The appointment of Dr. Robert Stanser, Rector of St. Paul's, to
the Bishopric of Nova Scotia, vacant by the death of Bishop
Charles Inglis, took place in 1817. Interest had been made with
Lord Bathurst, the Colonial Secretary, and the Archbishop of
Canterbury to have Dr. John Inglis, son of the late Bishop,
appointed to the See. The appointment was said to have been
arranged in favor of Dr. Inglis, but a recommendation from both
branches of the Legislature then in session in favor of Dr. Stanser,
their Chaplain, prevailed, and Dr. Inglis was appointed Rector of
St. Paul's, vacant by the elevation of Stanser to the Bishopric.
Dr. John Inglis proved a highly popular Rector; his bland manners
and kind disposition rendered him a favorite with all classes and
denominations, and when he afterwards, in 1825, obtained the
Bishopric he carried with him to England addresses in his favor not
only from his own parishioners, but largely signed by his friends
among other denominations.</p>

<p>The remains of the old Bishop were brought to town from
Aylesford, where he died, and buried under St. Paul's Church on
the 29th February. The funeral was attended by the Governor, Sir
J. C. Sherbroke, Sir John Wentworth, the retired Governor, His
Majesty's Council and a large assemblage of the citizens. A
monument to his memory is on the west side of the chancel of
the church.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th April great excitement prevailed
throughout the town in consequence of a murder which had been
committed in one of the streets during the previous night. Capt.
Westmacott of the Royal Engineers who, as officer of the night,
was going his rounds on horseback to visit the guards, met
two men in Sackville Street whom he challenged in consequence of
their suspicious appearance. They immediately attacked him and
by a sudden effort threw him from his horse, having first wounded
him fatally with a bayonet. He lingered until the 4th day of May,
when he died. The murderers were soon after discovered and
proved to be two soldiers, deserters from one of the regiments in
garrison. They had been stealing fish through the night from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
store on one of the wharves. They were identified by the Captain
and, being tried and convicted of the murder, were executed on the
Common.</p>

<p>The Nova Scotia Fensible Regiment, after the close of the war,
remained in Canada for some time. Early in June of this year they
embarked at Quebec for Halifax. The transport in approaching
Halifax ran upon a reef of rocks known as Jeddore ledges, which
lies off the harbour of that name eastward from Halifax. The
weather was calm and the troops were landed in safety, with the
exception of four private soldiers, two women and several children,
but with the loss of considerable part of the baggage. It was found
on landing the men that the tide was rising, and that in all
probability the greater part of the ledge would be covered at high
water. It was proposed that the women and children should be
first landed and placed on the higher part of the rock. But on the
soldiers perceiving that Colonel Darling, who commanded the
Regiment, and several of the officers were intending to avail
themselves of the higher parts of the ledge, immediately declared
that all officers should be compelled to remain with their respective
companies and share the fate of their men. One officer, a captain, is
said to have shown symptoms of impatience or something worse on
the occasion, and abandoned his wife and family and his men,
seeking shelter for himself on the rocks amidst the reproaches and
jeers of his comrades. The Regiment was, however, successfully
landed on the ledges, chiefly through the heroic exertions of the
Adjutant-Lieutenant Stewart, who volunteered to carry a cable from
the bowsprit of the ship to the rock, when having there made it fast
the sailors were enabled to construct means for landing men in
safety. Part of the Regiment was brought to Halifax in coasting
vessels about the first July, and others found their way by land,
having been brought on shore from the rocks by the fishermen of
the neighbourhood. Col. Darling and some others being displeased
at all the credit of the exploit being attached to Lt. Stewart, who
was probably not a favorite of the Colonel, brought him to a Court-Martial
for some trifling offence supposed to have been a breach of
orders, and it is said he was compelled to leave the Regiment.</p>

<p>Two very extensive fires occurred at Halifax this year. One on
the 8th October, remembered as the "Haliburton" fire in consequence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
of the brick building at the corner of Hollis and Sackville
Streets owned by Mr. George Haliburton, having been the first
house consumed. The fire destroyed nearly the whole block from
Haliburton's corner to where Mrs. Howard's new stone building
stands, on the east or lower side of Hollis street. All the
buildings on Sackville Street down to the corner known as
Reynolds' corner, and the whole of the buildings on the upper or
Western side of Bedford Row were consumed. The fire commenced
at ten o'clock in the evening and continued to rage until six o'clock
next morning. It was considered the most disastrous fire that had
ever occurred in Halifax. The old buildings were all of wood
except Haliburton's corner house. The block was soon rebuilt
with a better description of buildings. Mr. W. K. Reynolds
erected a fine stone store at the corner of Sackville Street and
Bedford Row, which still remains; this was far the finest store in
Halifax at the time. A range of brick buildings along Bedford
Row were at the same time erected by the late Nicholas Vass.
Haliburton's corner was also rebuilt of brick, and the buildings on
Hollis street, the property of Mr. LeNoir and others, were built
about the same time by the late Judge William Hill and his brother
T. T. Hill, then both at the Halifax Bar. Several old wooden
houses were pulled down during the fire by order of the firewards to
prevent the spread of the fire. The town was assessed to pay the
damage. The other fire was on Water Street at Creighton and
Grassie's wharf. It occurred in the night of 17th December,
during very cold weather. All the stores at and near the head of
the wharf were consumed, and the fire extended to buildings on the
opposite side of the street. Mr. Grassie rebuilt with brick and
stone, and afterwards lined the shutters of his new store with sheet
iron.</p>

<p>The Earl of Dalhousie, a Scotch nobleman, who had distinguished
himself in the Spanish campaign as a general of Division under
Lord Wellington, had been appointed to succeed Sir J. Cope
Sherbrooke in the Government. He arrived in Halifax on 24th
October, 1816, in the Frigate Forthe. Lord and Lady Dalhousie,
immediately after their arrival, landed in state and proceeded to the
Council Chamber under a salute from the Citadel attended by the
heads of Departments, civil and military, when the Earl was sworn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
into office in presence of His Majesty's Council. The troops lined
the way from the King's wharf to Cochran's building where the
Council Chamber was then situated.</p>

<p>There had been no theatrical performances worthy of mention in
the town since the Duke of Kent's old theatre in Argyle Street had
been appropriated to the school under Mr. Bromley. In the autumn
of this year a company of players, Messrs. Price, Chamock,
Placide, etc., fitted up an old store on Fairbank's wharf as a theatre.
Placide, Price and Mrs. Young were considered good performers
and attracted large audiences. At the close of their career the
manager got into jail for debt, when Placide, the best comic actor
of the company, distinguished himself by escaping from prison and
passing the sentry at the jail gate in the night, who supposed it
was a Newfoundland dog, Mr. Placide being famous for imitating
the bark and whine of the canine species.</p>

<p>1817. The winter of 1816-17 was much more severe than that
of the preceding year. The south-east passage was closed with ice
all winter, and the ice remained until late in April. Great distress
prevailed in the town as usual among the laboring classes during
this winter, which was also the case throughout the whole Province.
The sum of £600 was contributed this winter by the inhabitants of
Halifax for the support of destitute emigrants who had been
brought up from Newfoundland.</p>

<p>An attempt was made by the Legislature in their session of 1817
to relieve the pressing necessities of the county by an Act authorizing
the Governor and Council to procure copper coin to the value of
£2,000 to be issued from the provincial treasury. The Act was
disallowed by the Colonial Secretary in England. No good reason
appears to have been assigned for its rejection. The circulating
medium at this time in the town and throughout the country was
Spanish doubloons, old Spanish dollars, pistareens and other
small Spanish coins, with a mixed collection of copper coinage,
English and Spanish, with all kinds of half-penny tokens issued by
private individuals in the town. No British coinage ever reached
Halifax except the old English Guinea. The troops were paid in
old Spanish money, which was brought from South America and the
West Indies by the merchants in exchange for their cargoes of fish
with occasional importations of Spanish silver by the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
Government for the troops, etc. An issue of paper money was at
this time made under an Act of the province.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1817 that the project was first broached for
the establishment and erection of a college on the Grand Parade.</p>

<p>The sum of £9,750 was then remaining in the hands of the
Governor from the revenues collected at Castine while the State of
Maine was in the hands of the British troops. This sum Lord
Dalhousie obtained the permission of the Colonial Secretary to
appropriate towards the erection of a college in Halifax on the
model of the Scotch Universities. The professors were to receive
moderate salaries. The students were not to reside in the college
building, but only to attend courses of lectures which were to be
open to all students and all else who might feel disposed to purchase
tickets for the courses.</p>

<p>This winter the theatre on Fairbanks' wharf was again in
operation and as attractive as ever. Miss Powell was at this time
giving lessons in dancing. She gave her spring ball at Mason Hall
on 21st May. This lady, who was patronized by the fashionable
part of the community, was the daughter of Mr. Powell who
conducted the theatre in Argyle Street when under the patronage of
the Duke of Kent. She lived many years in Halifax and died
at an advanced age, having been dependent on the charity of her
friends for several years before her death.</p>

<p>The naval force on the station had now been reduced to a few ships
under the command of Rear Admiral Sir David Milne, father of
Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Milne, who some time since commanded
on the North American Station. Sir David's flagship was the
Leopard, Frigate.</p>

<p>It may here be noticed that the British and Foreign Bible Society
had lately organized a branch in Halifax. The second annual
meeting of the branch society took place on the 5th May. It was
attended by the Earl of Dalhousie, who occupied the chair, and a
number of officials. The chief speakers on the occasion were Judge
James Stewart, the Rev. Dr. Archibald Gray, of St. Matthew's, and
Judge Wilkins. Martin Gay Black was treasurer and Walter
Bromley, secretary. Mr. Black continued to act as treasurer of
this society to the year of his death. The Speaker of the House of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
Assembly and a number of the members of the House were also
present on this occasion.</p>

<p>The great destitution of the laboring part of the population
during the winter, as usual, rendered it necessary on behalf of the
Commissioners of the Poor for the town to call on the inhabitants
for contributions in addition to the annual poor rate assessed. The
poor house at Halifax was then, as has been the case frequently
since, the receptacle for transient paupers from the country, and the
sum of £300 was voted this year by the House of Assembly towards
the expenses of the establishment.</p>

<p>The charitable societies of St. Patrick and St. Andrew dined
together on the respective anniversaries of their patron saints.
Richard J. Uniacke, the Attorney General, occupied the chair at
the St. Patrick's dinner, and Dr. Samuel Head the Vice. The
Governor, Mr. Philip Woodhouse, the Commissioner of the Dockyard,
the Bishop of Nova Scotia, the Commanding Officers of the
Garrison and other distinguished guests were present at both
dinners.</p>

<p>A fire occurred in the southern part of Granville Street this winter,
which destroyed the chocolate manufactory of Mr. John Ferguson
and his dwelling house. The fire companies of Halifax at this time
were, perhaps, the most useful institutions in the community.
These companies consisted of several hundred gentlemen each, who
formed themselves into a company for the purpose of rendering
assistance at fires. Each member provided himself with a leather
cap, two or three buckets, canvas bags, etc., on which were
painted the name of the owner and device of the company. The
members were elected by ballot. They held quarterly meetings and
occasionally dined together, and gave annual balls at Mason Hall.
The Heart and Hand and the Hand in Hand Companies were the
oldest, but the Sunfire Company was the most exclusive. The
Ph&oelig;nix Company was also very efficient, being composed chiefly of
young tradesmen of the town. The Engine Company was a very
ancient institution, and tolerably efficient, considering the kind of
machinery they had to work with. The Axe Company, as now,
was composed of carpenters and others suitable for such work at
fires. It was customary for the soldiers in garrison to turn out at
fires and form lines with the inhabitants for the conveyance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
water by buckets, handed through the lines from the harbor or the
wells and tanks of the town. One feature which is now never seen
at fires was the guard which was furnished by the military to take
charge of the property removed to the streets from the burning
houses. Scarcely a pile of furniture or goods could be observed
without a sentry over it with fixed bayonet pacing up and down.
The supply of water was principally drawn from the wells and
pumps which were kept in order by the Magistrates of the town.
These pumps have been before noticed. The inhabitants of the
suburbs, however, depended for good water on their private wells.
Almost every house in Brunswick and Lockman Streets had a good
well in the garden or near the house. The north suburb lots were
of very large dimensions; fruit gardens were numerous; the plum,
the Dutch cherry and red and black currants were raised in
abundance. The caterpillar and other vermin which now infest
the fruit gardens had then not been imported.</p>

<p>Among the names of merchants who were carrying on business
this year in Halifax we notice those of John Pryor, father of
the late City Judge, Henry Pryor, William Strachan, White,
Creighton &amp; Co., Ironware Merchants, Wallace &amp; Russell, Hardware
and Wines, at the corner of Hollis and Prince Streets, now
occupied by the Union Bank; Prescott &amp; Calkin, Fruits, etc., in
Granville Street; James Leishman &amp; Co., Woolen Ware, lately from
Glasgow; Hartshorne, Boggs &amp; Co., Hardware, etc., at the old
stand, corner of Granville and George Streets, and S. &amp; W. DeBlois
at the opposite corner. The firm of Hartshorne &amp; Boggs existed
for many years. The head of the firm, the Hon. Lawrence Hartshorne,
retiring from business, the name was altered to Boggs &amp;
Hartshorne; the late Thomas Boggs became head of the business
and Lawrence Hartshorne, Jr., afterwards County Treasurer, was
junior partner. The business continued until the old corner building
was taken down, about the year 184-, and replaced by the fine
stone edifice erected by Mr. George E. Morton on the site.</p>

<p>Scarff &amp; Bain, afterwards James Bain<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> &amp; Co., carried on an
extensive importing business at the corner now occupied by W. &amp;
C. Silver. James Romans, Boots and Shoes, who succeeded Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
McNab at the old corner of Granville and Prince Streets, lately
owned by Mr. Robert Romans, who succeeded his father in the
business; John Witham and Thomas Donaldson, the former
Groceries and Wines, the latter Confectionery, were fashionable
resorts on the lower side of Granville Street. Mrs. Jane Donaldson
carried on the business after the death of her husband and finally
retired to her residence at Birch Cove on the Basin, which had been
purchased from the late Andrew Belcher on his leaving the province
for England. Sherwood, which was built by Bishop Stanser, was
also the property of Mrs. Donaldson. The late William Donaldson
afterwards sold it to Thomas Kenny, Esq. James Donaldson, the
brother of Donaldson of Granville Street, was also a Confectioner
and carried on business at the corner of George and Barrington
Streets, now occupied by Cragg Bros., opposite the Parade,
and was afterwards succeeded by the late Adam Esson. The
principal auctioneers were Bowie &amp; DeBlois, Moody &amp; Boyle, Fillis
&amp; Perkins, and Charles Hill &amp; Co. The latter carried on business
in Bedford Row near the corner of Sackville Street. Among the
dry goods stores were Israel Allison &amp; Co., Carnot &amp; Alport,
where Mr. Duffus afterwards erected his stone building; Thomas
Cleary, M. G. Black, Winkworth Allen &amp; Co., in Cochran's Buildings
near the market. Among the importing and West India
merchants, Abram Cunard &amp; Co., Lawrence Doyle, Collins &amp;
Allison, Collins' Wharf; James Forman, Sr., James and Michael
Tobin, Tobin's Wharf; Thom, Salter &amp; Co., Ship Chandlery.</p>

<p>A court for the summary trial of actions in the town was established
this year. The Commissioners named by the Governor and
Council were James Forman, Richard Tremain, William Minns,
Charles Boggs and James Tobin. The Commission bears date in
April of this year.</p>

<p>In addition to the public schools before mentioned, Mr. Thomas
Crosskill kept a good school for young men in rear of the Acadian
School, entrance from Barrington Street; his classes were more
advanced than those of Mr. Bromley. Mr. Addison kept his
classical academy in Marchington's Lane. There were several
schools for young girls. Miss Wenman kept a school for small
children in Granville Street; she was one of those who were burned
out in the great fire before mentioned. Mrs. Henry in Barrington<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
Street and Mrs. McCage, for young ladies, also in Barrington
Street, in the brick house lately the property of Mrs. Doctor
Slayter.</p>

<p>On the 25th April, 1818, a public meeting was called to petition
the British Government to make Halifax a free port so that
foreigners might have access and take cargoes of the produce of the
country or merchandise imported into it; accordingly, on the 27th
May, an order of the Prince Regent in Council was obtained
making Halifax and St. John, New Brunswick, free ports. Halifax
was declared by proclamation of the Governor bearing date
August 13th.</p>

<p>At the request of the inhabitants of the town an Act of the
Legislature was obtained this year authorizing the leasing of 25
acres of the Common for a period of 999 years at a small ground
rent. The lots were each 60 feet in front by 330 feet deep. These
lots were gradually disposed of and the broad street known as
Spring Garden Road was laid out with the lots fronting on it.
Very few of these lots were built on at first, and not until many
years after was there any appearance of improvement in this part
of the town. The only residence westward of the General's
quarters was the house of old Colonel Pyke, the Police Magistrate,
which stood in the field next his brewery.</p>

<p>About this time the late John Stayner, of Water Street,
commenced to erect the building known Brookside, afterwards
the residence of the late Hon. Joseph Allison. Many years
afterwards John Spry Morris, the Surveyor General, erected the
building, and planted the trees, lately occupied by D. Cronan. The
fields on the west side of Queen Street, opposite the General's
quarters, known as Pedley's Fields, or Smidtville, were not then
built upon and the whole space from the present line of Queen
Street to the Tower Road was occupied as pasture for cattle.
Queen Street led up to Fort Massey military burial ground; it was
covered with grass and seldom used except for military funerals.</p>

<p>Owing to the frequent alarms of fire and other disturbances in
the town this winter, the Magistrates made application to the
Legislature for an Act to establish a night watch, and accordingly,
on the 5th May, a nightly watch was established by order of the
Governor and Council for three months.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
During the spring of 1818 and the previous autumn, several
vessels arrived in this port with emigrants from Europe, many of
whom were found to be in a most destitute condition. They could
not be permitted to remain a burden on the town and the Governor
and Council advanced funds to assist their removal to the country,
and Mr. Samuel Cunard and Mr. Michael Tobin were intrusted with
the funds for the purpose.</p>

<p>"On the 9th February there remained of these emigrants in
town only 20 families and 30 single men. Their distress and
that of the humbler classes in the town this winter induced
the Governor to place £100 more in the hands of Messrs. Tobin
and Cunard to be used by them to mitigate the suffering of the
poor in general. They, in consequence, established for a time
a public soup house, beginning with 50 gallons of soup a day;
but in three days they were obliged to double the quantity,
finding that 50 pounds beef and vegetables, producing 100
gallons a day, did not more than answer the demand. The
fitting up of the place and eight days' issue cost over £50, and
they supposed the money would be all gone in a fortnight more.
They attended constantly in person at the daily issues and say
that 500 daily partook of the gift. They estimated that £200
more would be required to keep up the establishment until the
pressure of want should be alleviated in some other way. The
first £50 was paid out of the Arms Fund, £100 from the Treasury,
and the House voted £200 on 10th February for temporary relief
of the poor at Halifax."&mdash;[Murdoch.]</p>

<p>Eight armed fishing vessels were seized this summer by the ships
of war on the station, and brought into the Harbor of Halifax.
Five were released and three condemned in the Court of Vice-Admiralty.</p>

<p>A general election occurred this year. The poll for the County
and Town of Halifax was opened at the County Court House on
Monday, 15th June, and continued until Wednesday, when one of
the candidates, Mr. Richard Kidston, having withdrawn, the other
two, Mr. John Albro' and Mr. H. H. Cogswell were returned.
Capt. Thomas Maynard, R. N., was Sheriff this year. He resided
in the old house in Jacob Street formerly known as the Grenadier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
Fort, which stood on the spot where the Trinity Church has since
been erected.</p>

<p>Among the events of the year worthy of notice was the appearance
of Anthony H. Holland, proprietor of the Acadian Recorder
newspaper, (which had been established in 1813) at the Bar of the
Assembly to answer charges of having published severe animadversions
on public affairs, particularly from some remarks relative
to Edward Mortimer, one of the County members, for which Mr.
Holland suffered a short imprisonment. This affair, with the
letters of Agricola, which now began to appear in the same paper
brought that paper into public notice.</p>

<p>A Bill was introduced into the House of Assembly this session
by Mr. Shaw, who resided near the Three Mile House, for lighting
Water Street, but it does not appear that the object was effected.</p>

<p>Paper money, issued from the Provincial Treasury, had been for
some time in circulation and had to some extent taken the place of
the Spanish Silver, which had been, heretofore, the only circulating
medium in the town.</p>

<p>During the month of February this year, the harbor was blocked
up with float ice as far down as George's Island. Between 13th
and 20th, persons crossed from Dartmouth on the ice at the Narrows.</p>

<p>In the "good old days when George the Third was king," his
birthday, the 4th June, was celebrated with great enthusiasm at
Halifax. A levy at Government House, a review of the troops, and
sometimes the militia on the common, and a royal salute from the
Battery and shipping in harbor, terminating with a ball in the
evening.</p>

<p>This year the officers of the 3rd Halifax militia regiment gave a
dinner at the Exchange Coffee House in the large room lately occupied
by the Corporation as a Council Chamber. The North British
Society also dined together on St. Andrew's day at Mason's hall.
Lord Dalhousie, and all the heads of departments, civil and military,
and Bishop Burke attended. Judge Brenton Halliburton was
President, and Geo. Mitchell Vice-president.</p>

<p>Dr. Burke had been officiating priest at St. Peter's, the old Roman
Catholic church which stood on the present St. Mary's grounds at
the head of Salter Street. He was this year appointed Bishop for
this province under the title of Bishop of Zion. He was consecrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
at Quebec on the 5th July. Dr. Burke was a very popular clergyman,
was highly thought of in the town and was very remarkable
for his hospitality, great benevolence, and Christian self-denial and
care for the poor. Though on several occasions engaged in theological
controversies with Dr. McCulloch of Pictou and others, he
never permitted those differences of opinion to interfere with that
kindly and gentlemanly intercourse with his friends for which he
was so remarkable.</p>

<p>On the 15th December this year the Agricultural Society of Nova
Scotia was inaugurated at a public meeting held at Masons' Hall.
The Earl of Dalhousie presided, the Hon. S. B. Robie, Judge
Brenton Halliburton, Rev. Dr. Inglis, afterwards Bishop, and S. G.
W. Archibald addressed the meeting. Resolutions were passed for
the organization of the society, Lord Dalhousie appointed President,
and John Young, the author of the letters of Agricola, was
appointed Secretary with a good salary. Chief Justice Blowers
was named as Vice-president, and a Committee of twenty named
to manage the business.</p>

<p>Mr. Placide's theatre at Fairbanks' wharf was again in full
operation this winter; Mrs. Young was the favorite actress, and
young Mr. William Blake, a native of the town who joined the
Company, acquired much popularity. Mr. Blake afterwards visited
Halifax as manager of a company of play actors, about 1830 or '31.</p>

<p>Mr. John Black<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and James Fraser, two wealthy Halifax merchants,
were this year appointed to His Majesty's Council. Mr.
Black was senior member of the firm of Black, Forsythe &amp; Co.,
afterwards known as Fiddis, May &amp; Robinson. This business was
carried on for many years on the wharf at the foot of Prince Street,
lately the property of George Mitchell. Mr. Fraser<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> carried on
business near Commercial wharf. His residence was on the upper
side of Water Street nearly opposite his place of business. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
garden extended into Argyle Street, and occupied the space on
which the Salem Chapel stood.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1819 the excavations at the north end of the
Grand Parade were commenced for the erection of Dalhousie College.
A grant under the great seal of the province, of a part of the parade
ground had been made to Trustees as a site for the college in August
1818. The Legislature at their sitting in February, voted
£2000 towards the erection of the building and a sum of £3000,
part of the Castine fund before mentioned, was also appropriated to
the building, the balance together with an additional vote of £2000
from the province being invested for the support of the college.</p>

<p>The space known as the Grand Parade had been reserved for
military and other necessary purposes on laying out the town in
1749. It had never been military property or claimed by the
military authorities, but was originally reserved as a place of muster
for the militia of the town, though used also by the King's troops
for mounting guard. An old building originally erected on the
upper side of the space next Argyle Street for an Artillery barrack,
was remaining there as late as 1777, and ranges of cannon appear
in front of it in the old pictures of the town about that date.
Prince Edward when General Commanding at Halifax had the
parade ground walled up and a new rail or fence erected. The
surface was levelled and the wall built at the north end bringing the
surface high above Duke and Barrington streets; ice houses were
built under this wall which were occupied by Mrs. Jane Donaldson,
Confectioner of Granville street. This wall was removed to make
way for the foundation of the college building. It had always been
asserted as a right on the part of the inhabitants of the town, that a
free, unobstructed way for foot passengers should be kept open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
across the centre of the old parade from one part of George street
to the other, and wooden steps had been provided soon after the
wall along the upper side had been erected and a gate and turn stile
at the town side for the accommodation of the public.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> There was
a high wooden rail around the parade painted red.</p>

<p>The Province Building being now finished, the Courts of Justice
and the Public Offices were removed from Cochran's building, and
the Legislature, which met on the 11th February, took possession
of the chambers appropriated to the Council and Assembly with all
due ceremony.</p>

<p>The reduction of the Dockyard establishment this year was a great
loss to the town. A large force of workmen were discharged, many
of whom were thrown out of employ without any provision from
government.</p>

<p>The project for the removal of the Dockyard to Bermuda was
found in many respects not to have realized the advantages contemplated
by the change. It was removed at the time that one of the
Admirals on the Station had taken offence at some occurrences in
the town and had used his influence to effect the change.</p>

<p>A few years afterwards the Shears, a gigantic apparatus at the
Dockyard, for throwing down vessels, was demolished. The Shears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
was a very conspicuous object, and stood so high that it could be
seen from most parts of the town. It is still in the recollection of
many of our older citizens. The Royal Standard floated from the
staff which surmounted the Shears on the King's and Queen's birthdays
and other public holidays. The Dockyard of Halifax, as
mentioned in a previous chapter, was first established in the year
1758. The present wall was first erected in 1769 and bears the date
of 1770 over the gate, but it has been improved and some portions
rebuilt since that time.</p>

<p>Anthony H. Holland built a paper mill at the head of the Basin this
year, on the stream near the opening of the Hammonds Plains Road.
The paper made here was used for his newspaper, and the
various pamphlets which issued from Holland's press and occasionally
by other newspapers. It was of a very inferior quality. The
brown paper, however, used for shop purposes, was of a tolerably
good description. It was the first paper manufactory set on foot in
Nova Scotia. It was kept up for many years after the death of
Holland.</p>

<p>On the night of the 11th of November a fire broke out in
the Naval Hospital adjoining the Dockyard, which destroyed several
buildings. In consequence of the removal of the Naval Station the
space remained unbuilt on for many years.</p>

<p>The Magistrates of the town, in session in December, voted a
portrait of Chief Justice Blowers. It was painted by a Mr. Drake
in full dress, wig, and scarlet gown. This picture occupies a place
in the Legislative Chamber, with that of Chief Justice Sir Thomas
Strange, by Benjamin West, late President of the Royal Academy.</p>

<p>Among the promotions which appeared in the Royal Gazette this
year we find the appointment of Mr. Hibbert N. Binney<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> to His
Majesty's Council.</p>

<p>An event occurred in the month of July which cast a gloom over
the whole community. Mr. Richard J. Uniacke, junior son of the
Attorney-General of that name, a member of the Bar, in his address
to the jury at a trial before the Supreme Court, made some observations
offensive to Mr. William Bowie, of the firm of Bowie and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
DeBlois; a challenge from Mr. Bowie was the consequence, and on
the morning of Wednesday, following the 21st July, the community
was startled by the announcement that Mr. Bowie had been mortally
wounded. The duel was fought in the grove at the Governor's
north farm, near the Lady Hammond Road. Mr. Bowie was carried
to the house at the corner, then or afterwards occupied by Mrs.
McNeil as a tea house, where he died in a few hours, the bullet
having entered his right side below the rib. Mr. Uniacke and the
two seconds, Stephen W. DeBlois and Edward McSweeny, were
indicted for murder and tried the same term, and were acquitted by
the jury of the capital offence. This was the first criminal trial of
importance which took place in the Province Building. The Court
Room at the time, now the Legislative Library, comprised the three
rooms overhead, lately used by the keeper of the building. A large
gallery then surrounded the Court Room on three sides. This
gallery was removed in 1827 or 1828, the height of the Court Room
reduced, and the upper space made into three rooms, which were
appropriated to the Law Library, Admiralty Records, etc. This
unfortunate duel excited much feeling in the town, and some blame
was attached to the seconds who promoted or advised the parties to
fire a second time, when a reconciliation might have been effected.
The combatants were both gentlemen highly esteemed for their
amiable qualities. Bowie was a handsome young man and very
popular for his social qualities. He was buried from his lodgings
in town, and his funeral was said to have been more numerously
attended than any within the recollection of the oldest inhabitants.
Mr. Uniacke afterwards became a Judge of the Supreme Court.
The recollection of the sad event is supposed to have shortened
his life. He died at the early age of 45. Judge Uniacke was one
of the handsomest men Halifax ever produced, was more popular
than any other of his family, several of whom were in public positions.</p>

<p>1820. On 7th April, King George IV. was proclaimed at Halifax.
The ceremony was performed by the Governor, Council, and such
Members of the House of Assembly as remained in town, together
with the Magistrates, the Grand Jury, and a number of private
citizens, proceeding to the Council Chamber, where the proclamation
was signed by the Governor, Councillors, and others. David Shaw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
Clarke, the Clerk of the Peace, acted as Herald, accompanied by
the High Sheriff in a carriage, escorted by a body of troops. The
proclamation was read by the Herald in the Market Square, at St.
Paul's Church, and on the Military Parade in Brunswick Street in
front of the officers' old barracks. A royal salute was fired and the
procession then returned to the Province Building, where the proclamation
was again read. The Royal Standard, which had been
flying on the citadel, was then lowered to half-mast and minute guns
fired from George's Island, there being none mounted on the hill at
the time on account of the decease of the late King George III.
Sermons were preached in all the places of worship and the
inhabitants of the town went into mourning.</p>

<p>The House of Assembly being dissolved by the death of the
Sovereign, a public meeting of the freeholders of the Township was
held at the Exchange<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Coffee House on the 3rd May for the nomination
of the candidates to represent the town. Richard Tremaine,
Esq., was called to the chair. Mr. Stephen W. DeBlois nominated
John Pryor and George Grassie. Mr. Cogswell, the former member,
retired, also Mr. James Forman and Mr. John Young, both of
whom had been suggested. John Albro', one of the former members,
led the poll at the close of the election, Pryor and Grassie stood
even. Captain Maynard, the Sheriff, made a special return of the
facts. It was said that the last vote polled was that of the Sheriff,
who first declared the poll closed and then voted for Mr. Grassie,
which placed the candidates even. On the validity of his vote
rested the question of the majority. The election lasted three days
and closed on Saturday evening. At the close the poll stood,
Albro, 453; Grassie and Pryor, each 395. Freeholders or owners
of real estate only had the privilege of voting at this period. The
new House met on 12th November following, and Mr. Pryor having
died in the interim the House ordered the return of Mr. Grassie.</p>

<p>William Lawson, Simon B. Robie, Samuel G. W. Archibald, and
George Smith were returned for the County. Mr. Robie was
elected Speaker of the new House. Mr. Smith resided in Pictou,
the other three in Halifax. Pictou and Colchester then formed part
of the County of Halifax.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
The walls of the new College had now been built up even with the
surface of the parade ground, and it was arranged that the corner
stone should be laid with proper ceremony by Lord Dalhousie, the
patron and originator of the scheme. Accordingly, on the 22nd
May, 1820, the troops in the garrison were turned out and formed
a double line from the Province Building to the Grand Parade.
The Freemasons, under the Grand Master, John George Pyke,
proceeded from Mason Hall along Barrington Street and formed a
square on the Parade. About 2 o'clock, Governor Dalhousie, the
Admiral, the officers of the Governor's Staff, with the Members of
His Majesty's Council, the Magistrates of the town, and a number
of leading inhabitants, proceeded through the line of troops to the
south-east corner of the building. Dr. J. T. Twining, the Grand
Chaplain, offered a prayer, after which a brass plate containing the
necessary inscriptions and a quantity of coins, were placed under the
stone, after which the Earl addressed the meeting and explained
the objects contemplated in erecting the college. The stone was
then laid with all due Masonic ceremony. A royal salute was fired
from the forts and the whole was concluded by a ball and supper at
Government House.</p>

<p>On the 24th May, the corner stone of St. Mary's Roman Catholic
Church was laid with full religious ceremonies by Bishop Burke.
The old church of St. Peter, usually known as "the chapel" was a
small wooden building painted red. It stood opposite the head of
Salter Street, inside a rail, and was approached by a gate and turn
stile. This old building was the first Roman Catholic place of
worship in Halifax. It was built some time between 1785 and
1790. It was removed soon after the new building was ready for
occupation.</p>

<p>On the 29th November, Bishop Burke died in the 78th year of
his age. He was laid out in state in his Episcopal robes and mitre
for several days. Bishop Burke was succeeded by Dr. Fraser, Bishop
of Tanen in partibus. He resided at Antigonish. Mr. Miniot was
parish priest at this time; he was succeeded by Mr. O'Brien and
afterwards by Mr. Lochnan, etc., until the appointment of Bishop
Walsh. The St. Mary's Cathedral crept on slowly for many years
for want of funds, but was finished according to the original plan
about the time of the appointment of Bishop Walsh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
The Earl of Dalhousie having been appointed Governor General
of Canada on the death of the Duke of Richmond, a farewell ball
was given to him and his Countess by the officers of the garrison
on 28th May, and on 31st the inhabitants presented him with an
address. On the first of June, his successor in the Government,
Sir James Kempt, arrived at Halifax in the Phæton, frigate, Capt.
Montague, 42 days from England. He landed at the King's
Wharf, and was driven to Government House. At 3 o'clock the
same day he went to the Council Chamber, where he was sworn into
office.</p>

<p>On the 5th, Lord Dalhousie embarked for Canada. The flank
companies of the First Halifax Regiment of Militia, under the
command of Capts. John Liddell and John Pyke, attended on the
wharf as a guard of honor. Sir James Kempt brought with him as
A. D. C., Major Charles Gore, afterwards General Sir C. Gore,
G. C. B., Lord Frederick Lenox, a younger son of the Duke of
Richmond, who lately died in Canada, and Major Couper, afterwards
Sir George Couper, Comptroller of the Household of the
Duchess of Kent, the Queen's mother. Sir James Kempt was one
of Lord Wellington's Officers in the peninsular war. He commanded
a brigade at the Battle of Waterloo, and after the death of
Sir Thomas Picton, the General of Division, who was killed early
in the action, the command of the division fell to him.</p>

<p>The only other occurrences worthy of notice during this year were
the dinner given to Governor Dalhousie by the inhabitants of the
town, which took place at Masons' Hall on 17th June, the Hon.
Michael Wallace in the chair, and John George Pyke, Vice. Sir
John Wentworth, Baronet, the former Governor, died this year at
his residence, Mrs. Flieger's, Hollis Street. His death took place
on 8th April. He was in his 84th year. He was succeeded in his
Baronetcy by his son, Charles Mary Wentworth, a native of
Halifax, who had retired to England, where he held some subordinate
office under Government. At his death, unmarried, the title
became extinct. By his will, he gave the old villa and grounds on
the Basin, built by the Duke of Kent, to Mrs. Gore, the novelist,
who was a distant relative of his family.</p>

<p>A Fair and Cattle show was held by the Agricultural Society on
6th September on Camp Hill. The Governor distributed the prizes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
John Young, John Albro', William Young, John Starr, Peter
McNab and Frederick Major, Esquires, were Judges of the cattle.</p>

<p>1820-21. This winter was, if anything, more severe than the
three preceding. Early in January the harbor became frozen over,
and by the 20th the ice extended to Meagher's Beach and was
sufficiently strong to bear sleighs. By the 27th the ice formed a
firm bridge between Halifax and Dartmouth, over which a continuous
line of sleighs, teams and foot passengers might be seen
on market days. Skating and sleighing parties were numerous.
The Governor, Sir James Kempt, drove tandem almost to McNab's
Island, and the double sleigh of Judge Brenton Halliburton, in
passing over a weak spot in the ice, fell through but was rescued
without damage to the horses or the ladies in the sleigh. The
navigation was completely stopped for several weeks. A passage
was, however, cut from Cunard's wharf to the mouth of the harbor
with much labor and expense, to permit the Government Brig
Chebucto to proceed on her cruise. This little brig was owned by
A. Cunard &amp; Sons, and was employed by the Imperial Government
in cruising along the shores of the province to protect the fishery,
and at the same time to enable the officers of Government to visit
the outposts, and was occasionally employed on special service to
proceed to Quebec and other places with despatches, etc. The
channel through the ice by which this vessel was taken out, and
which ran along close to the wharves, was afterwards kept open
while the ice remained, and a boat and two rafts were used to
convey over passengers and sleighs.</p>

<p>On the 17th September, a fire occurred in the town, which
destroyed nearly all the buildings on the eastern side of Barrington
Street, between Sackville Street and Blowers Street and extended
back into Granville Street, where several houses were consumed.
Most of the buildings destroyed were old and delapidated except
those at the corner of Granville and Sackville Streets occupied by
Mr. Liswell's Bakery, etc. There were in all about 24 houses
consumed. A large portion of the burned district remained for
many years after unbuilt upon.</p>

<p>It was customary at this time for the dress companies of the
militia to give balls. On 23rd January the Grenadier and Light
Companies of the 1st Halifax Regiment gave a ball at Mason Hall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
at which 300 persons were present. The regiment was commanded
by Hon. T. N. Jeffery, the Collector of the Customs, who had only
lately succeeded old Col. J. G. Pyke in the command. John
Liddell commanded the Grenadiers and Brevet Major John Pyke,
the Light Company. Lieut.-Col. Richard Tremain commanded the
Town Artillery.</p>

<p>The condition of the transient poor of the town was very sad this
winter. An organized system of relief known as the Poor Man's
Friend Society, was instituted. The town was divided into wards,
and three or four gentlemen volunteered in each ward to visit the
poor throughout the winter months. A soup house was established,
and other arrangements made to meet the objects intended. This
society continued for about six or seven years. In 1824 Beamish
Murdoch was its secretary. The following year William Young
(the late Chief Justice) was acting secretary.</p>

<p>A large issue of paper money by the province took place in 1820.
Silver change was almost driven out of circulation by the issue of
small notes, many at one dollar, at 2s. 6d., and even at 1s. 3d.
These notes were issued by private individuals upon their own
credit and responsibility. Those of William Lawson and Adam
Esson were the most numerous. The doubloon was at this
time established at £4 currency, and the Spanish dollar at five
shillings. The price of flour had fallen to twenty-seven shillings
and six pence per barrel.</p>

<p>An anonymous pamphlet was published from the press of A. H.
Holland, charging the magistrates of the town with malpractices,
which caused much excitement. It was discovered to have been
written by Mr. William Wilkie, of Halifax. He was indicted
for libel, tried at the Easter term of the Supreme Court, found
guilty and sentenced to two years imprisonment with hard labor in
the House of Correction. This was esteemed a most tyrannical and
cruel proceeding on the part of the government. The pamphlet
was a very paltry offence, such as at the present day would be
passed over with contempt. Wilkie, though not a person of much
esteem, yet being a member of a respectable family in the community,
should have been spared the indignities thrown upon him
by Chief Justice Blowers and the other Judges of the Supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
Court. After the sentence was known, the sympathy in his favor
was very general throughout the town.</p>

<p>The reaction after the peace had reduced the price of agricultural
produce, not only in Halifax but throughout the province. The
West India trade, then the chief branch of commerce, had begun
again to be prosperous, and the merchants were looking forward to
profitable voyages. But the value of real estate had so fallen that
sales were made in the body of the town for much less than half the
cost of the buildings. This state of things continued for several
years, and very few new buildings were erected between 1819 and
1823. The population was about 15,000, but the number of houses
did not exceed 1,600.</p>

<p>The market square at this period presented a very different
appearance from what it does at present. A low wooden building
stood on the site of the present brick market house. The roof was
originally flat and afterwards a pitched roof was added. The
butchers' stalls in this old building were very convenient, perhaps
more so than those in the new market house. The cellars of this
building fronting on Water Street were let for the benefit of the
town, and the south end was, some time after this, occupied by
Mr. Alexander McLeod as a liquor store and grocery for many
years. The ground in front of the market wharf and market
slip was much lower than at present, and also that part of Water
Street between the old City Court House and Stayner's Wharf,
all which was filled up about 1830 or, perhaps, a year or two later.
A range of shops under the Court House before this alteration in
the streets afforded a large revenue to the town, but their value as
places of business was destroyed when the street was raised, and
though partially occupied afterwards, they proved damp and unfit
for storage of goods. The truckmen, who were then very numerous,
ranged their trucks and carts in lines in the square fronting
the meat market (there being no other stand allowed) and in
cold weather they might be seen, in the afternoons, when not
engaged in trucking, amusing themselves with the game of football.
Two liquor stores, one at the head of the market, on Beamish's
Wharf, and the other at the opposite corner, now known as
Laidlaw's corner, kept by Samuel and David Muirhead, were the
chief places where spirits and beer were retailed to the truckmen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
and fishermen. In front of these shops were ranges of apple and
cake stalls kept by old women, where also gull eggs and lobsters
boiled hard could be had by the fishermen and shallop men from the
wharves. The red woollen night cap was generally worn in those
days by the market fishermen and the people from the coasting
vessels.</p>

<p>The sidewalks throughout the town with the exception of part of
Water Street, were all of wood. The old platform on George
Street, between Granville and Hollis Streets, was known as Hartshorne's
platform. Messrs. Hartshorne &amp; Boggs occupied a range
of wooden buildings at the corner of Granville Street, since replaced
by the stone building erected by George E. Morton and now
occupied by Knowles' Bookstore. On the lower corner, known as
Martin Gay Black's corner, there stood an old gamble-roofed house
on a high green bank occupied by Mrs. Hart as a dry goods store,
and afterwards by T. &amp; S. Greenwood, watchmakers. This old
building was about this time replaced by another which afterwards
made way for the handsome free stone building erected by the late
Martin Gay Black.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> This platform was the resort of merchants
and others who congregated there in the mornings for a short walk
and to talk over the news. A large ship gun did duty as a post at
Hartshorne &amp; Boggs' corner, and another at Black's, and formed a
nucleus for loungers&mdash;not smokers, for smoking was strictly prohibited
in the streets of Halifax at this time by the Magistrates of
the town. Opposite, near the Province Building rail, was the old
town pump mentioned above, known as Black's pump, remarkable
for its good water, where dozens of boys and girls might be seen
towards evening getting water for tea. The old wooden range
known as Cochran's building, which occupied the site of the present
Dominion building, had been only lately evacuated by the Legislative
Assemblies and the Courts of Law, and was now being fitted
up for shops. Among those who first occupied shops in this
building were Winkworth Allen, who afterwards went to England,
Mr. David Hare, who afterwards became the purchaser of the
property; W. A. Mackinlay, on the north side, and Clement H.
Belcher, at the north-west corner, both well known stationers and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
booksellers, occupied their respective shops a long time, the latter
for more than twenty years. At the opposite corner, to the south,
on Hollis Street, stood a large three story building erected by the
late James Hamilton, who carried on an extensive dry goods
business. It was afterwards sold to Burns &amp; Murray, who erected
the present handsome freestone edifice on the corner. Mr. William
A. Black kept his watchmaker's establishment at the corner below,
now occupied by the P. Walsh Hardware Co. The old Halifax
Journal office occupied a wooden building at the corner of
George and Granville Streets, where the stone store of T. &amp; E.
Kenny now is. Mr. Benjamin Etter had his watchmaker's shop at
the corner of George and Barrington Streets, now known as
Crosskill's corner, in the same old wooden building which has since
undergone extensive alterations. Mrs. Donaldson carried on the
confectionery business at the corner opposite and was succeeded by
Adam Esson. There were two Donaldsons, both confectioners,
whose wives carried on the business after the death of their husbands
and accumulated large properties, usually known as upper and
lower Donaldson's; the latter was in Granville Street and was the
most fashionable, being patronized by the military and navy officers
during the war. The parade ground was surrounded by a high
wooden rail painted red and had a gate and two turn stiles opposite
George Street; the latter for foot passengers who claimed the right
to pass across the ground to the steps which led up into Argyle
Street, and which still remain. John Howe kept the Post Office in
the old building opposite the parade later occupied by Mr. Brander,
Cabinet Maker. The late Matthew Richardson a year or two later
erected the three story stone building next to Mrs. Donaldson on
the site of the Hon. Andrew Belcher's garden, which occupied an
open space south of Donaldson's or Esson's corner. Mr. Belcher
had, a few years before this, left Halifax to reside in England.
His residence was in Granville Street, the same building formerly
owned and occupied by the late Doctor Hoffman a short distance
south of Kenny's buildings and his garden extended in rear fronting
on Barrington Street. No part of the city has undergone
greater changes since this time than Granville Street. From
George Street northward all the old houses on both sides have been
replaced by lofty buildings with some rare exceptions. Between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
Romans' corner and the Ordnance Square, the street at this time
was elevated about 20 or 25 feet above the present level. It was
cut down about the year 1830 or 31, (perhaps a little earlier) and
the old shabby buildings on the upper side removed, and those on
the lower side had an additional story added to them below in consequence
of the street being lowered. The whole of this part of
Granville Street has been since twice destroyed by fire and replaced
by the present buildings, at a cost and in a style far beyond the
requirements of the city. Proceeding southward along Hollis Street
from the Province Building, both sides as far as Sackville Street
were occupied by a range of small low buildings. At the corner
now occupied by the Queen stone building, there stood an old
gamble roofed house of one story with a little shop at the corner
occupied by a worthy old man, James Smith, who held the office of
Deacon of St. Matthew's Presbyterian Church, opposite. The
other deacon was James Dechman, senior, who was for many years
keeper of the town clock, and resided in the clock building. These
two old worthies have long since gone to their rest. The latter was
father of the late James Dechman, of Halifax, master carpenter,
who died at an advanced age some years ago at his residence in
Bishop Street. The Rev. Dr. Archibald Gray<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> was minister of
St. Matthew's at this time. His place of residence was the old
house in Granville Street, opposite the Province Building, now
known as the Acadian Hotel. Several buildings both in Hollis and
Granville Streets, remnants of the first settlement, stood on high
grassy banks with porches and steps outside and cellar doors on
the side of the bank with plank platforms over the gutters; the
porches and steps frequently projecting out on the side path.</p>

<p>The Hon. John Black, a short time previous to the year 1821,
built the fine granite building in Hollis Street north of Government
House, afterwards the property of his son-in-law, Hon. James B.
Uniacke, since the residence of the Bishop of Nova Scotia. The old
house within the railing at the upper corner of Hollis &amp; Salter
Streets, lately owned by Mr. Esson, was then the residence of Hon.
William Lawson. It was originally built by Malachi Salter about
1760, perhaps before. At the opposite corner stood the residence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
of the Hon. Hibbert N. Binney, since removed. At the other corner
Mr. Charles R. Fairbanks, some time Solicitor-General, afterwards
Master of the Rolls in Chancery, son-in-law of Mr. Lawson, had
just erected the fine brick building since occupied as a boarding
school for young ladies. The late Samuel Lydiard Brewer built the
iron stone house of three stories south of Mr. Binney's residence
about the same time. The residence of the Hon. Michael Wallace,
Treasurer of the Province, was in Hollis Street immediately opposite
the Government House. It was a wooden building and considered
a first class residence in its time; now altered into two separate
dwelling houses. Trees were common in the streets of Halifax at
this period as has been before mentioned. The stone building in
Morris Street, the residence of Chief Justice Sir Brenton Halliburton,
then Judge Halliburton, had been erected some years before this.
Judge Stewart, his brother-in-law, built the yellow brick building
at the north-west corner of Hollis &amp; Morris Streets, now the
residence of a gentleman of the same name, son of Hon. Alexander
Stewart, late Master of the Rolls and Judge of Admiralty. The
Hon. Thos. N. Jeffery, Collector of the Customs, built and resided
in the building later occupied by Mrs. James Donaldson. The late
Bishop Inglis, then Rector of St. Paul's, owned and occupied the
low wooden building nearly opposite Mr. Jeffery's, since the residence
of Mr. Hagarty. At the corner, opposite Judge Stewart's, was the
old gamble roofed house, the residence of James B. Franklin, son
of Governor Franklin. This old fashioned house still remains as
one of the few relics of the early town. The Hon. Charles Morris
built a handsome wooden dwelling house on the south side of
Morris Street, between Hollis and Water Streets, afterwards the
property of Hon. S. G. W. Archibald, Attorney-General and
Speaker of the House of Assembly; since his death occupied as a
boarding house. The late John Trider about the same time built
his rough stone house at Freshwater Bridge. The late John
Tremain had a Ropewalk adjoining his residence on the south side
of the road leading up from Freshwater Bridge, now known as
Inglis Street. This property was afterwards purchased by James
Forman, Junior, and the old ropewalk building removed. The
residence of Major Bazelgette at the head of this street had been
originally constructed by John Trider from the materials of the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
Government House which had been removed and the materials sold
to make way for the foundation of the Province Building. It afterwards
became the property of the late John Moody, a merchant in
the town, who sold it to Major Bazelgette about the year 1817 or
1818, who added to the building and improved the grounds. Mr.
Moody purchased the adjoining grounds and erected a new house;
after his failure his residence was purchased by Hon. Enos Collins,
who improved the property and beautified the surrounding grounds.</p>

<p>Old Fresh Water Bridge, so well known in former times, crossed
the stream from Smith's Tanyard nearly in the same place as the
present abutment. It was a rickety old wooden structure with a
rough curb or rail. It was a favorite resort of the young of both
sexes on Sundays and summer evenings, and the old wooden rail
was covered with names and initial letters carved with the pen knife
by visitors. The walk down Pleasant Street and up the road now
known as Inglis Street and round the new road, as the Tower Road
was then called to Pyke's Bridge, and thence down Spring Garden
Road to Government House, was the fashionable promenade for all
classes on Sundays and holidays. The old English Burial ground
was then surrounded by a high, rough stone wall, built without mortar,
which was removed some years after the new cemetery on Camp
Hill was consecrated. The Governor's garden up Spring Garden
Road adjoining the burial ground extended as far as the General's
quarters. A portion of this field was taken for the site of the
new Court House and County Jail. The new Poor House in the
opposite space, then lately erected, was a rough stone building
whitewashed on the outside, but the Work House or House of Correction
was the old gamble roof building probably originally erected
as a soldiers' barracks in the days of the forts, and afterwards used
as a Poor House. All these buildings have been since removed and
the ground sold to private speculators, a step much to be regretted,
as the space was very extensive and the most eligible situation for
a public building in the whole city.</p>

<p>The Poor House Burial Ground, at the corner opposite the
present new Court House, was at this time a standing nuisance in
consequence of the want of drainage and the careless manner in
which bodies of paupers were interred. After the law for closing
all places of burial in the city had been carried into operation, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
open space was planted with trees and ground carted in to fill up
hollow places, and a substantial wall built around it. The old tan
Yard of Andrew and John Smith was then one of the most
picturesque and secluded spots in the neighborhood of the town.
The stream which turned their mill passed down from the south
common through Smith's Fields, where it formed a pond near the
town road, known as the mill dam, for many years the resort of
skaters in winter, continuing south-eastward to Freshwater Bridge
and passing through a range of willow trees, some of which may
still be seen above the present bridge. Southward from old bridge
the road was at this time but a footpath winding along the shore to
Steele's Pond, beyond which it was passable for carriages. At a
very early period, however, there had been a broad carriage road all
along the shore to Point Pleasant, but the earth had fallen in or
been washed away by the tide. Black Rock, a point running out
south from Trider's old lime kiln, was then, and for many years
after, the resort of bathers. There was a fine gravel beach outside
the old Freshwater Bridge leaving a large expanse of gravel when
the tide was out. It was customary for gentlemen's servants,
truckmen and others who came morning and evening to water their
horses in the stream above the bridge to ride their horses in the surf
at low water.</p>

<p>That part of the city known as Schmidtville, or Pedley's Fields,
west from Queen Street and the General's quarters, was not laid
out into building lots until many years after the period we are now
describing.</p>

<p>The stone house at the corner of Prince and Argyle Streets,
opposite the south-west angle of St. Paul's Church, was originally
the mansion of the Hon. Richard Bulkeley, and is, perhaps, now the
oldest stone building in Halifax; it was purchased about 1818 by
H. H. Cogswell, who improved the old house and resided there until
his death in 1854. The stone house at the opposite corner was
built after the close of the war by Dr. William J. Almon. It
afterwards became the residence of his son, Matthew Byles Almon,
who sold it to Dr. Daniel McN. Parker. Proceeding southward
along Argyle Street at the next corner was the handsome residence
of Hon. Richard John Uniacke, who held the office of Attorney
General for a great number of years. This was a wooden building<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
of three stories originally with a flat roof and a parapet all around
with ornaments in the shape of urns at the corners and in the
centre. A roof was put on this building about the time of the
death of old Mr. Uniacke, and the parapet removed. At the south
termination of Argyle Street stood the residence of Mr. Alexander
Creighton, a small low house, and along Blowers Street, to the west,
was a low range of wooden buildings which had been a soldiers'
barracks or guard house. The late Chief Justice Blowers, about
the commencement of the present century, erected the large wooden
building at the corner of Barrington Street, adjoining the Roman
Catholic property, as a residence. After his death it was sold and
became a hotel under the name of the Waverley House. It has
since been purchased and attached to the Roman Catholic church
property.</p>

<p>In the year 1821 there were no houses in Gottingen Street, north
suburbs, except the stone house at the corner of the lane leading
westward, some years before built by Major McCola, Town Major
of Halifax, since owned by Mr. R. Duport. A wooden house, a
short distance north of it, built by Peter Hay, Mason, and the old
hipped roofed building at the corner of Gerrish Street, known as
the North Pole, still standing. Mr. Lewis Demolitor had then
lately built a large house at the northern extremity of Brunswick
Street, which at that time was considered a very wild speculation.
This is the same house lately the residence of the Hon. Senator
Northup. The late Benjamin Etter also, about this time, built
himself a residence at the corner of North Street, afterwards the
mansion of the late Hon. William A. Black. Captain Michael
Head, R. N., occupied the two story house to the westward of W.
A. Black's property, which a few years before had been built by the
late William Rudolf, of Halifax, and was afterwards the residence
of Commissary General, W. H. Snelling, and afterwards by John
Northup; now or lately known as Belle-Air. Lockman Street
then could boast of very few buildings and was so grown up
with grass as in some places only to afford a narrow path in
the centre for pedestrians and occasionally a stray carriage. The
original Lockman Street extended only from North Street to
Gerrish Street, in the rear of what was called the Dutch Lots; it was
afterwards continued southward by consent of the north suburb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
lots, as far as Cornwallis Street. The old house, formerly the
residence of Major Leonard Lockman, a German officer, one of the
original settlers, for whom the street was called, stood on the
western side near the northern extremity of the street. It became
very delapidated and was removed some years ago.</p>

<p>In the 1818, or perhaps as late as 1820, that part of the
north common known as Camp Hill, since appropriated as a public
cemetery, as also all the swampy space westward of the drill
ground, was in a state of nature, covered with cradle hills, laurel
bushes and ground juniper. The butchers' boys kept their sheep
there, and in autumn the swampy portions afforded to the sportsmen
good ground for snipe, plover and curlew. An old building,
known as the St. Andrew's Cross, stood on the hill at the corner
where Quinpool Road, so-called, now meets the common. On the
opposite side an old two story house called Quinpool, which had been
the residence of a Mr. O'Brien, stood in a field to the north of the
road. This old house became uninhabited and was afterward taken
down by Dr. Cogswell, the proprietor of the property, when he
divided the fields into building lots. There were two main roads
leading from town to the Basin, both meeting at what was called
the Three Mile House, a building erected by Mr. Shaw, a member
of Assembly, as a hotel, afterwards known as Increase Ward's
country house. The Wistermont Road was known as the Blue
Bell Road from a very old house with a swinging sign which stood
at the corner before you arrive at the Willow Park property. Mr.
John Young, known as the author of the letters of Agricola, had
then lately purchased this latter place, had improved the house and
gardens, and was commencing to work it as a model farm. Further
north were the old Dutch farms of Philip Bayer and Jacob Shefforth
on either side of the road, surrounded by groups of old willow trees.
The Bayer's house has disappeared, but that of the Shefforth family
fell to the late Mr. Henry Vieth, who repaired the old buildings.
The other road, known as the Fort Needham or Lady Hammond
Road, was a prolongation of Gottingen Street. After passing the
farms of the late John and James Merkel, it turned to the westward
down the hill to the shore of the Basin at the Three Mile House.
The Kempt Road had not yet been opened though for some time in
contemplation. Two block houses, the remnant of the old fortifications<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
of Halifax, overlooked these roads. The first or nearest
blockhouse, was at Fort Needham on the hill south of the Governor's
north farm. The other surmounted the hill just above the cottage
of the late John Steel, called Three Mile Cottage, at the termination
of the Blue Bell Road, near the present Three Mile Church. The
old house at the Governor's north farm known as Lady Hammond's
house was then in good repair, since fallen down. This house was
erected by Lieut. Governor Hammond as a country residence for
his family. The north farm, as it was called, extended eastward to
the shores of the narrows and included the beech grove near the
old railway station. This beautiful grove has been lately cut
up by one of the Government Railway Superintendents who caused
building lots to be laid off and sold in the grove. This fine
collection of trees has been carefully preserved for nearly a century,
and had been the scene of many festivities, and was associated with
very many pleasing events in the minds of the older citizens.</p>

<p>The common was the usual resort of a large portion of the
inhabitants on a Sunday afternoon during the summer months. It
had been the custom for many years, and had continued to be so
until discontinued by Governor Maitland, for the whole garrison,
which usually consisted of service companies of three regiments, a
part of artillery, and a company of sappers and marines, to parade
on the common every Sunday afternoon at three o'clock during the
summer season. The Governor and his staff attended and the
whole brigade, with their regimental colors, and the artillery, with
their field pieces, formed a line and were inspected by the Governor
or Commander-in-chief, after which they marched around the drill
ground, passing before him at slow time, saluting him in open
column of companies. No booths, however, were allowed on the
common for the sale of refreshments except on the King's and
Queen's birthdays, when grand reviews came off.</p>

<p>Sunday presented a gay scene at Halifax in those days. There
being then no garrison chapel for the troops, the regiments in
garrison, preceded by their brass bands playing, marched in full
dress to St. Paul's and St. George's churches amid the ringing of
bells and the sound of martial music. The carriage of the
Governor (who was then always a general officer) in full military
costume, with his aides-de-camp, drove up to the south door of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
St. Paul's, the whole staff having first assembled under the portico
which then ran along the southern end of the church. His
Excellency, followed by a brilliant display of gold lace and feathers,
the clank of sabres and spurs, and the shaking of plumed hats of
so many officers, many of whom were accompanied by their ladies,
on entering the church, presented a most brilliant spectacle. All
this was followed by the old Chief Justice Blowers in his coach and
livery, the carriage of the Admiral, and those of several members
of Council. All being seated and the body of the church full of
fashion and dress, the peal of the organ began to be heard and the
clergy in surplice and hood (he who was about to preach, however,
always in the black gown) proceeded from the vestry up the east
side aisle to the pulpit, preceded by a beadle in drab and gold lace,
carrying a large silver headed mace, who, after the clergy had taken
their seats, deliberately walked down the aisle again to the vestry
with his mace over his shoulder. The Rector, Dr. John Inglis,
usually preached in the morning, and the Curate, Mr. J. T.
Twining, performed the service. They were frequently accompanied
by other church clergymen on a visit to town, and in Lord
Dalhousie's time, his Chaplin, the Rev. Isaac Temple, always took
part in the service, frequently preaching in the afternoon at 3
o'clock. On the sermon in the morning being concluded, the troops
marched back to barracks and the general and staff returned to
Government House, where they partook of luncheon, and were
again in requisition by 3 o'clock for the grand review of the troops
on the common. There were no evening services in the churches
and meeting houses in those days, except with the Methodists, who
were quietly doing their work in the old Argyle Street meeting
house, under the Rev. Wm. Black.</p>

<p>The police of the town were conducted by one paid magistrate
and one unpaid assistant, together with the clerk of the peace and
three police constables, afterwards increased to four. Old Colonel
Pyke presided as Chief Magistrate for many years, and was usually
to be seen sitting in the little police office in drab knee breeches
with gray yarn stockings and snuff colored coat. Age and infirmity
having at last compelled him to retire, Mr. John Liddell, the second
in command, was appointed Chief Police Magistrate by Sir James<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
Kempt.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> David Shaw Clarke had been for some years Clerk of the
Peace. He was a member of the Bar and particularly well qualified
for the office he held, the duties of which he performed with much
satisfaction to the public. He was very remarkable as being the
most corpulent man in town. The late Samuel Muirhead, who kept
a liquor shop at the head of the Market Wharf, was next in size
to Mr. Clarke. Muirhead died in 1820, and Clarke, from that
time to the day of his death, had no competitor. No man was
better known or more popular for about thirty years in Halifax
than David Shaw Clarke. He was succeeded in his office by his
son James Stewart Clarke.</p>

<p>Drunken people were frequently to be seen in the streets in those
days, yet the peace of the town was tolerably well preserved by the
three or four police constables. Old Jock Henderson was very
corpulent, but his great knowledge of his profession rendered him
an exceedingly useful officer. Jack Mahar was celebrated as a
detective, but king alcohol at last put an end to his usefulness.
The practice of publicly whipping thieves had almost altogether
gone out of fashion by this time, though occasionally resorted to at
the work house. Among the town oddities was Constable Hawkins.
He was a negro, one of those who were brought from the Chesapeake
by Admiral Cockburn. He had been for some years employed at the
work house to do the whipping. He was usually dressed in an old
military green uniform, epaulets, plumed cap, with red sash, and on
state occasions, a sword. With constable's staff in hand, this
worthy might be seen in the morning at the opening of the police
office, escorting prisoners down George Street to the office for
examination, accompanied by a mob of boys. Among the other
curiosities of the town was old Ben Myers, usually known as Major
Ben. This old fellow, an idiot, was dressed in a long tailed red
coat of a fashion then long obsolete, a cocked hat and long white
feathers hanging over his shoulder, and on particular occasions, a
star on his breast and a sword and sash. He was the messenger of
the poor house and Bridewell and came down to the market every
morning with his wheelbarrow in which he brought back supplies
for the establishments.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
The troops mounted guard every morning on the Grand Parade
and went through the salute and troop before relieving guard. This
formed a great attraction to strangers and people from the country.
The band usually played for half an hour before the ceremony of
inspecting the guards commenced. At sunset and at gun fire, at
eight o'clock in the evening, the drum and fife proceeded from the
town clock, in Barrack Street, to Government House or the
General's quarters, and back again to the barracks. This had been
an ancient custom in the Halifax garrison and was partly kept up
until about the year 1845. Guard mounting on the parade at 10
o'clock in the morning during summer continued until Governor
Le Marchant left Halifax in 1856.</p>

<p>One feature of the town which frequently afforded amusement to
visitors must not be omitted. The negro population of Hammonds
Plains and Preston, the latter particularly, had been, after the
peace, supplied with the American uniform coats taken at Castine
or somewhere in Maine in the year 1813. The sky blue coats with
red and sometimes yellow facings, in conjunction with old torn and
patched trousers of every description, presented the most grotesque
appearance. A short time before this a fensible regiment known as
the York Rangers, having been disbanded in the town, their old
green uniforms, faced red, and the sugar loaf shaped caps, were
given to the negroes, who presented the most ridiculous appearance
on market days.</p>

<p>M. Geneni kept dancing school at Mason Hall and gave many
pleasant school balls in the winter season to the great delight of
the young people. M. Perro, a polite old French naval officer, was
most popular as a teacher of French and was much esteemed in the
community. M. Chenalette was the most famous confectioner ever
known in Halifax. In his latter days he kept his establishment in
Sackville Street, opposite Bedford Row, and was celebrated for his
French cordials and fancy confectionery. Such was Halifax in
1821 and thereabouts.</p>

public purpose, such as the old burial ground, public landing, the common,
etc., had been used for the purpose to which it was originally appropriated but the
title had been supposed not to have passed out of the Crown. Towards the close of
the last century it was thought advisable to vest all the public property in Trustees
under several grants from the Crown for that purpose; accordingly a grant was made
of the parade ground to certain public officials and their successors in office, to be held
by them for the public purposes for which it had been originally reserved. This grant
with all the others had been constructed under the supervision of old Attorney General
Uniacke and of Chief Justice Blowers, but it having been afterwards discovered that
none of the public officials to whom it was granted possessed the corporate powers and
therefore had no succession in law, and the original incumbents at the time of the grant
being all dead, it was concluded that the title had lapsed to the Crown. Lord Dalhousie,
Mr. Wallace and a few others in their exuberant zeal for the erection of a
college on the Scotch model, undertook to have another grant from the Crown
passed of the whole or part of the parade ground to the Governors of the College,
reserving, it is understood, certain privileges over a portion of the ground to the public.</p>

<p>The Governors of Dalhousie College claimed under this grant. The City contends
that the old grant was not forfeited and that this space among other public property
appertaining to the town was under the Act of Incorporation turned over to the city.
That in order to create a legal forfeiture there must be process of Escheat gone through,
and further, that though the public functionaries to whom it was granted were not
possessed of corporate rights or had any succession of their offices in law, yet the fact
of their having been by Royal patent constituted trustees of the property, by inference
of law the Crown intended to make them a corporation for that particular purpose, and
that their successors in the various offices they held, or the successor of any one of
them, would possess the power of supporting the grant. Otherwise the object of the
Crown in making the grant would be defeated, and as Crown grants are always constituted
in law most favorably for the Crown, it might be inferred that the Crown
intended to support its grant by constituting those public officers and their successors
in office a corporation with succession for that special purpose. Later the dispute
was settled by private arrangement.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="sub">FORTIFICATIONS AND DEFENCES OF THE TOWN&mdash;PUBLIC BUILDINGS, ETC.</span></h2>

<p>From the year 1749 to '54 or '5, the defences of the town
consisted of palisades or pickets placed upright, with block houses
built of logs at convenient distances. This fence extended from
where the Roman Catholic Cathedral now stands to the beach south
of Fairbanks' wharf, and on the north along the line of Jacob Street
to the harbor. These palisades were in existence in 1753, but were
removed at a very early period, not being within the recollection of
the oldest natives of the town living in the year 1825.</p>

<p>A large portion of the front of the present Citadel Hill was
originally private property; a small redoubt stood near the summit
with a flag staff and guard house, but no traces of any regular or
permanent fortification appear until the commencement of the
American Revolution. There were several block houses south of
the town&mdash;at Point Pleasant, Fort Massey and other places. A line
of block houses was built at a very early period of the settlement,
extending from the head of the North West Arm to the Basin, as a
defence against the Indians. The foundation of the centre block
house was still to be seen in 1848 in the hollow below Philip Bayers'
pasture. During Governor Lawrence's time, the Indians made an
attack upon the saw mills at the head of the North West Arm,
which stood near the site of the present mills, and murdered three
men; their bodies were buried by the soldiers near one of the block
houses, and were three times dug up by the Indians in defiance of the
guard, for the purpose of securing the scalps. These block houses
were built of square timber, with loop-holes for musketry,&mdash;they
were of great thickness, and had parapets around the top and a
platform at the base, with a well for the use of the guard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
In 1755, four batteries were erected along the beach&mdash;the centre
one, called the middle or Governor's Battery, stood where the
Queen's Wharf now is, being then directly in front of Government
House; another where the Ordnance Yard was afterwards built,
called the Five or Nine-gun Battery; the third was situated north of
the present Fairbanks' wharf; and the fourth called the South or
Grand Battery, still in existence at the Lumber Yard. They were
composed of stone and gravel, supported by cross logs, covered
with earth and planted with grass, having battlements in front and
the two ends, elevated about twenty or twenty-five feet above the
water. These fortifications were removed about the year 1783, and
the grounds appropriated to their present purposes. The Ordnance
Yard, then a swamp around the battery, and the King's Wharf,
were both filled up and levelled by stone and rubbish removed from
the five-acre lots of the peninsula which were beginning to be
cleared about this time.</p>

<p>There were block houses along the beach, near the Dock Yard
wall, built by Col. Spry about 1775. The drawings of the town,
published about the year 1774 or '6, show a strong fortification on
George's Island.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> It was not until the commencement of the
revolutionary war that regular works appear to have been constructed
for the defence of the town and harbor. About the year
1778, the Citadel Hill appears to have been, for the first time,
regularly fortified; the summit was then about eighty feet higher
than at present; the works consisted of an octangular tower of
wood of the block-house kind, having a parapet and small tower on
top with port holes for cannon&mdash;the whole encompassed by a ditch
and ramparts of earth and wood, with pickets placed close together,
slanting outwards. Below this there were several outworks of the
same description extending down the sides of the hill a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>Fort Massey, George's Island and the East Battery exhibit the
same kind of fortifications in the pictures of the town made about
1780. At the latter place there was a barrack, afterwards rebuilt
by the Duke of Kent about 1800.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
During the American Revolutionary War, Colonel Spry, the chief
engineer, erected a battery and several small block houses near the
old Dutch Church in Brunswick Street. Several fields on the north
and east sides of the Citadel were then taken by government and
equivalents given to the owners. There was another block house
at the extremity of Brunswick Street, in the field adjoining the
present Admiralty grounds; the first were demolished about 1783,
and part of the land granted by the Crown as a parsonage lot for
the minister of the Germans, but the latter remained many years
after till it fell into decay.</p>

<p>The Lumber Yard, Ordnance Yard and King's Wharf were all
commenced about the same time, (1784 or '5) but the present
buildings were put up at a much later date. The north barracks
were built soon after the settlement. The buildings known as the
south barracks were erected under the directions of the Duke of
Kent, as also the north barracks, destroyed by fire some years ago.</p>

<p>During the revolutionary war the main guard house stood on the
spot now occupied by the Mason Hall. It was used as a military
post at a very early period, as the French prisoners from Annapolis,
etc., were lodged there. The guard house was removed over ninety
years ago, and the present building afterwards erected.</p>

<p>A building called the Military Office stood at the south corner of
the market wharf, near where the main guard house now is. It
was used as a military office until 1790, or perhaps later. At this
time a guard was kept at the Prince's old playhouse, where the
Acadian School now stands.</p>

<p>The house lately owned by Capt. Maynard, where the Trinity
Chapel now stands, in Jacob Street, was a barrack as early as
1769. It was the site of one of the old block-house forts erected at
the first settlement. It continued to bear the name of the Grenadier
Fort until removed to make room for the present brick edifice
known as Trinity Church.</p>

<p>The old wooden fortifications were removed from Citadel Hill
about the time Prince Edward was Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>The hill had been cut down and ramparts of earth constructed
mounting five or six guns at each angle, with a deep ditch. There
were also covered ways and passages leading into the fort; willow
trees were planted round the ramparts, and the whole was surrounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
by a picket fence. The remains of this work were removed at the
commencement of the present fortifications. Much of the old work
was performed by the militia drafts from the country, embodied at
Halifax at the close of the last century, particularly in 1793, during
Sir John Wentworth's administration, and at subsequent periods.
The Maroon negroes from Jamaica were for a short time engaged
on these works.</p>

<p>The towers on George's Island,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Point Pleasant, the East Battery,
Meager's Beach and York Redoubt were built at the commencement
of the present century. The Prince established signal stations
between Halifax and Annapolis, the first post being on the hill
behind his residence on Bedford Basin. He levelled the ground
called the Grand Parade, and it is said, built the walls at the
north-east and south-west angles. The Chain Battery at Point
Pleasant was first constructed, it is said, by Lord Colville, in or
about 1761. The present ring bolts were put down the war of
1812-15. The old block house at Fort Needham and that on
the hill above Philip Bayers' farm on the road leading to the Basin,
called the Blue Bell Road, were built during the American Revolution,
and re-constructed during the Prince's time. They were
there in 1820, but soon after fell into decay, being composed of
square timber only. All the other block houses had disappeared
many years previous to that date. The building used as an army
hospital, which stood on the north slope of Citadel Hill, in rear of
the north barracks, since destroyed by fire, was erected as the town
residence of Edward, Duke of Kent, when commander of the forces.
The low range of buildings since used as barrack stores and as a
military library, were his stables and offices. His residence was a
very elegant building with a portico supported by Corinthian pillars
in front, all which remained for many years after it became an
hospital. About the same time he built his villa on the Basin, the
ruins of which were to be seen a few years ago. The Rotunda, or
band room, still remains. The lands where the buildings stood
were the property of Sir John Wentworth, the Governor, to whom
he left it on his removal from the garrison. The old Rockingham
Inn was his guard house, since burned down.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
In the year 1765 there were two hospitals in the north suburbs,
near the beach at the foot of Cornwallis Street, called the Red and
Green Hospitals. They were there in 1785. One stood on the site
of the present North Country or Keating's Market, the other on
property now owned by the heirs of late H. H. Cogswell.</p>

<p>Until the year 1780 the streets of the town were in a very rough
condition, and some of them least frequented were impassable for
carriages, from stumps of trees and rocks. As early as 1761, there
was a good road to Point Pleasant;&mdash;it was a continuation of
Water Street, and said to have passed through or near the present
Lumber Yard grounds, following the shore of the harbor.</p>

<p>In 1764 the people of the north suburbs applied to the Governor
and Council to call their settlement Gottingen. The name soon fell
into disuse; the main street obtained the name of Brunswick Street,
the rear street only retaining that of Gottingen.</p>

<p>The first Government House was erected soon after the town was
laid out; the frame and materials were brought from Boston, and
the apartments prepared for the reception of the Governor early in
October. He held a council there on the 14th of that month. It
was a small low building of one story, surrounded by hogsheads of
gravel and sand, on which small pieces of ordnance were mounted
for its defence. It stood in the centre of the square now occupied
by the Province Building. About the year 1757 or '8, this little
cottage was removed to give place to a more spacious and convenient
residence. It was sold and drawn down to the corner of
George Street and Bedford Row, opposite the south-west angle of
the City Court House, and again, about 1775, removed to the beach
and placed at the corner of the street leading to the steam boat
landing, where it remained until 1832, when the present building,
occupied lately by Thomas Laidlaw, was erected on the site. The
new Government House was built during the time of Governor
Lawrence. Lord William Campbell built a ball room at one end,
and several other improvements were made to the building by
subsequent governors. It was surrounded by a terrace neatly
sodded and ornamented. The building was of wood, two stories
high. The office of Capt. Bulkeley, the Secretary, stood at the
north-east angle of the square inside the rails. Prince Edward
resided in this house with Governor Wentworth in 1798. This old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
house was pulled down about the commencement of the present
century and the materials sold to Mr. John Trider, Sr., who used
them in the construction of the building on the road leading to the
tower at the head of Inglis Street, formerly owned by Colonel
Bazelgette, and afterwards the residence of the late Mr. George
Whidden.</p>

<p>St. Paul's Church is now, perhaps, the oldest building remaining
in Halifax. It was erected at the expense of government in the
year 1749, and was esteemed one of the best constructed wooden
buildings in America. The oak frame and materials were brought
from Boston, and the building was ready for divine service by the
autumn of 1750. It received an addition to the north end with a
new steeple somewhat similar to the old one in the year 1812.
The first sermon was preached in this building by the Rev. Mr.
Tutty<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> on 2nd September, 1750. It remained in nearly all respects
as at its first erection until certain late alterations have changed its
appearance, particularly an addition to the south end from which
the fine old altar window, with its Doric pillars and small panes has
been removed to make way for a large Gothic window full of
painted glass, altogether incompatible with the architecture of the
building itself. The old escutcheons in the galleries have been
permitted to remain. The walls below are covered with monuments
and tablets recording the deaths of governors, military commanders,
who fell during the old American and French wars, and not a few
of our leading citizens. The most conspicuous are those of
Governors Sir John Wentworth, Wilmot, Lawrence, and Sir
John Harvey, Capt. Evans of the ship Charleston, who was killed
off the coast of Cape Breton in defence of a convoy against a
superior French force, Lord Charles Montague, late Governor of
Georgia, who died of fatigue after a journey in winter from Quebec
to Halifax by land, the Right Rev. Charles Inglis, first Bishop of
Nova Scotia, and his son Dr. John Inglis, third Bishop of the
Diocese, Baron De Seitz, who commanded the Hessian troops in
the old war, General McLean, the Hon. Richard Bulkeley, Attorney
General Uniacke, with a number of others of lesser note. The first
organ was purchased, partly by private subscription, during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
incumbency of Dr. Breynton, about 1765. It was replaced by a
new one about 1829, but the old case of Spanish walnut was
preserved.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The old German church of St. George, in Brunswick Street,
bears the date 1760 on its spire. It was originally erected by
private subscription among the German settlers of the north suburbs
in or about the year 1752 or '3. After the removal of the Germans
to Lunenburg there were but fifteen families of Germans remaining
in the north suburbs. This small congregation, not knowing any
English, erected the building on the German burial ground as a
school house and chapel. The present steeple was erected in 1760,
and the following year the building was dedicated as a church by
Dr. Breynton of St. Paul's, after which the congregation followed
the forms of the Church of England. Dr. Breynton on that
occasion preached in German and in French, after which he
addressed the congregation in English. In 1783 Rev. Bernard
Houzeal, a Lutheran minister, came to Halifax among the Loyalists
from New York and, having been ordained a minister of the Church
of England by the Bishop of London, became the minister of St.
George's, receiving a stipend from the Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel in Foreign parts. He died about the close of the last
century, a few years after the present round church, known as St.
George's, was erected, and Mr. Gray was appointed to the charge,
after which service in the old church was discontinued. It was then
appropriated as a school house. About the year 1833 or '4 it
underwent a thorough repair which was superintended by several
persons in the parish who were descendants of the original German
settlers.</p>

<p>Old St. Matthew's was coeval with the first settlement of Halifax.
Governor Cornwallis assigned a lot at the south-west corner of
Prince and Hollis Streets for a dissenting meeting house in 1749.
It was built soon after at the expense of government, and was
called Mather's Church in compliment to the memory of Dr. Cotton
Mather, the celebrated New England Congregationalist divine, by
the dissenters then in the town, who were principally from New
England and of that denomination. The Rev. Aaron Cleveland,
from New England, was the first minister who officiated in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
building. The Presbyterians from Scotland and the North of
Ireland, having become numerous in the town, soon amalgamated
with the American dissenters, and gradually obtained exclusive
possession of the building, after which it received the appellation of
St. Matthew's Church. The late Rev. Mr. Russell, father of the late
George N. Russell, of Halifax, officiated there for some time after
it became Presbyterian. Dr. Archibald Gray was the officiating
minister there for about twenty years; he was succeeded by Rev.
Ebenezer Renny, Rev. Mr. Knox, and finally by Rev. John Scott,
the last minister who preached in the old building which was burned
in the great fire which destroyed a considerable portion of Hollis
Street, on New Year's day, 1859. The lot of land on which it
stood was, some years after, sold to Doull &amp; Miller, who erected
there a large stone warehouse, which is one of the neatest and
most substantial buildings in the city.</p>

<p>The first market house occupied the site of the brick building
lately used for the City Courts and offices. It was built soon
after the settlement. A balcony ran along the lower side which
was used by merchants, etc., as a public promenade. About the
commencement of the present century the remains of this old
building were removed to make way for the brick edifice. The
upper portion of the new building was let as a public coffee house;
the large room now used as a City Council Chamber was appropriated
for public meetings, festivals, etc., and the south end,
above the police office, was occupied for many years as the
Exchange or Merchants' Reading Room.</p>

<p>The first court house in Halifax, as before mentioned, stood at
the corner of Buckingham and Argyle Streets, where Northup's
store and country market stood later. Chief Justice Belcher held his
court there in 1755, and the first Representative Assembly held
their session there in 1758. It was destroyed by fire about the
year 1783. Chief Justice Belcher resided in the old house in
Argyle Street to the north of the old Methodist meeting house,
formerly owned by the Rev. William Black, Methodist minister.
This building, at the time of its removal, was one of the very few
old buildings then remaining in the town. It was taken down
some years ago and a range of shops and a market house now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
occupy its site. The old Zoar chapel, the cradle of Methodism
in Halifax, has been lately turned into shops.</p>

<p>The stone house at the corner of Prince and Argyle Streets,
opposite the south-west angle of St. Paul's Church, was originally
built by the Hon. Richard Bulkeley, the first Provincial Secretary,
and was his residence for many years. It was purchased by the
Hon. H. H. Cogswell about 1818, and since his death has undergone
extensive alterations to render it suitable for a public hotel.
It is known as the Carlton House. There is an old house still
standing on the western side of Grafton Street, in Letter &mdash;&mdash;,
Forman's Division, which was the residence of William Nesbitt, the
Attorney General of Nova Scotia and Speaker of the Assembly, in
1760. After the death of Mr. Nesbitt, towards the end of the last
century, it fell to his daughter, Mrs. Swann. This old lady died
there nearly 80 years ago and the property was afterwards sold.
The street was cut down about 50 years since and a story or breast
work was erected on the street under this little old cottage which
may yet be seen projecting from the main building, presenting the
appearance of a balcony. The residence of Richard Gibbons,
formerly Attorney General, stood at the corner of Buckingham and
Grafton Streets, formerly known as George Isles' corner; it was
lately taken down and replaced by a range of brick buildings now
owned by Mr. Maloney. This was also one of the remnants of the
first settlement of the town. The building at the corner of
Barrington and Sackville Streets, formerly occupied as the Halifax
Grammar School, is also a very old building. The House of
Assembly held its sittings there in 1765, perhaps earlier. After
the court house was burned down the Supreme Court met there for
several years. It was also used at one time for a guard house. It
was devoted to the purpose of a school on the establishment of the
Halifax Grammar School in 1785.</p>

<p>Houses of entertainment were numerous and well kept at an early
period. The Great Pontack was a large three-story building,
erected by the Hon. John Butler, uncle to the late John Butler
Dight, previous to 1757, at the corner of Duke and Water Streets,
afterwards known as Michael Bennett's corner, now Cunningham's
corner. It was the principal hotel in 1764. In 1769 it was kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
by John Willis. The town assemblies and other public entertainments
were held at the Pontack in 1758.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The Crown Coffee House, frequented by country people, was
kept by William Fury in 1769 on the beach near the Dockyard.
Jerusalem Coffee House occupied the northern extremity of the
block near the Ordnance Yard, opposite Collins' wharf, between
Hollis Street and Collins' stone stores. It was built by the Hon.
Thomas Saul as a private residence about 1753 and afterwards
occupied by the Hon. Alexander Brymer; some of the rooms were
highly finished and ornamented with carved work, and the whole
establishment was on a scale beyond any other private residence in
the place. It was let out for a coffee house about 1789, or perhaps
earlier. This old building was destroyed by fire in 1837. The
present stone store known as the Jerusalem Warehouse occupies
the site of the old mansion.</p>

<p>Public Gardens were much in fashion between 1753 and '80.
Adlam's garden was an extensive enclosure south of the Citadel,
near the present Artillery Park and south barracks. It was opened
to the public, contained a pavilion and a great variety of fruit trees
and shrubs. The Artillery Park was then kept on the Grand
Parade; the Artillery Barracks stood in a line with the late engine
house; the Parade was not levelled at that time; a foot path from
George Street passed through the centre, and the descent at the
north-east corner was very abrupt.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Spring Garden was another
place of public resort in 1768. At this time there was a Provincial
Gardener, who received an allowance of £32 10s. per annum.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
About 1764, Mr. Joseph Gerrish, of His Majesty's Dockyard, laid
out an extensive garden in the north suburbs and imported fruit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
trees at great expense. This was a private enclosure, extending
from Lockman Street to the beach, south of the Dockyard; his
dwelling house stood in the centre and faced the harbor. Part of
the old wall, a year or two since, was to be seen in Lockman Street.
The old Governor's gardens, west of the English burying ground,
were well kept up for about 30 years. There was a large summer
house in the centre.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant, the victualling agent, had a large fruit garden south
of Government House, where St. Matthew's Manse now stands,
extending from Hollis to Pleasant Streets. It was surrounded
by a stone wall. Ornamental trees were, at an early period,
very numerous in the suburbs, particularly in the south, and
tended much to the beauty and comfort of the town. The poplar
trees which stood in front of the residence of the late James Kerby
and others, in Brunswick Street, and the willows on the eastern
side of the street, near the round church, are within the recollection
of many of the old inhabitants. The fine old willow trees which
occupied both sides of Argyle Street near the residence of the late
Attorney General Uniacke, those at the south end of Hollis Street,
near the Lumber Yard, and those around St. Paul's Church, are
also still within the recollection of many. These trees were all cut
down by the Commissioners of Streets in 1829 and 1830, because
they grew on the side paths and were therefore deemed an encroachment
on the public highway. Halifax was thus denuded of its
shady walks by the gentlemen of taste who constituted the Commissioners
of Streets at that period. Within the last few years
several attempts have been made to re-produce trees on the sidewalks,
but with partial success, there being no protection afforded
to them by the city authorities.</p>

<p>Before the year 1760, the houses were generally built of square
and round timber, some with small pickets placed upright between
the stubs of the frame, and the whole covered over with clap
boards; they were usually of one story with a hipped roof, the
shops and half doors with no glass, swinging signs, and wooden
shutters opening downwards, on which goods were exposed for
sale. Several of these old houses were in existence in 1850,
windows and doors being altered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
In 1768 and '77, there were lamp posts at all the principal
corners, the town being then lighted at the public expense.</p>

<p>The Dutch in the north suburbs usually built with the ends of
their houses to the street; those of the better sort had ornamental
windows and heavy cornices with weathercocks, One or two of
these old houses were to be seen in Brunswick Street about thirty-five
years ago. Among the old houses which have now disappeared
was one which stood in the field opposite the lower wharf, near
Point Pleasant; it was built about 1770, and occupied by General
Fanning about 1783.</p>

<p>A year or two after the settlement Mr. Gerrish built several
small stone houses near the tower; the clearance east of the pine
woods is still to be seen; they were occupied for a short time by the
settlers from the north of Ireland who went to Cobequid.</p>

<p>A large wooden building stood in the centre of the enclosure now
occupied by Government House, built before the American Revolution,
and used as a residence for field officers and other military
purposes. The public hospital stood on part of the land now
occupied by Government House to the north of the present house;
it was afterwards sold; probably the spot on which St. Matthew's
church now stands.</p>

<p>The first jail stood where the late Mr. Robert Brown's house in
Hollis Street stood, opposite the Halifax Hotel; the jail was kept
there till 1787, or thereabouts. In 1777, the Provost Marshal was
suspended from his office in consequence of the repeated escape of
prisoners from this building.</p>

<p>In 1752, government purchased a small stone house built by Col.
Horseman for a prison, probably a military one; this was near
where St. Mary's Cathedral now stands.</p>

<p>One remnant of the first settlement, now forgotten, was an old
hardwood tree which stood on the beach, just above high water
mark, at the corner of the Market Slip; this tree was used as a
public gallows from 1749, and was there within the recollection of
one or two aged persons living in 1825; it was cut down about
1763, but the stump remained until 1784 or '5.</p>

<p>The progress of crime between 1749 and '54, was perhaps less
rapid than might have been expected among a population of 5,000
or 6,000, composed of such materials. During the first five years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
there were fifty criminal trials on record, many convictions for
grand larceny, which was then the subject of capital punishment.
After the appointment of Chief Justice Belcher, convictions were
less frequent; most of the executions, as in the time of the general
court, were for stealing or receiving stolen goods.</p>

<p>The Dockyard was first established at Halifax in 1758. It was
extended and improved in 1769. The date over the gate is 1770.
The walls have since undergone several renewals.</p>

<p>The Town Clock was erected early in the present century jointly
by the garrison and the town. The merchants of Halifax raised a
subscription towards the object. It was placed at the head of
George Street for the convenience of the inhabitants. It was
managed by the garrison. The late James Dechman, senior, was
keeper, and resided in the clock for many years; he died about 1829
or 1830.</p>

<p>According to the plan of the town made by Col. Desbarres in
1779 or '80, and published in his nautical charts in 1781, there was
a nine-gun battery about where the Ordnance wharf now is, and the
five-gun battery a little to the north, but on an angle with the
other. Gerrish's wharf, since known as Marchington's wharf, was
immediately north of the five-gun battery, and Joshua Mauger's
wharf at the foot of Jacob Street. Proctor's wharf appears to have
been situated near where Cunard's old wharf now is. The old
market wharf, known as Fredericks' wharf, and afterwards as
Beamish's wharf, was as at present. Fillis' wharf appears to
have been that now known as Mitchell's, south of the Queen's
Wharf. Terrance Fitzpatrick's wharf was situated about the spot
now occupied by Esson &amp; Boak's wharf. Crawley's was to the
south of the latter, and Collier's about where Pryor's wharf now is.</p>

<p>There was a battery at the Commissioners' point at the south end
of the Dockyard, and the storekeeper's wharf ran out to the south
of the Commissioners' point somewhere, apparently, in the vacant
space between the Dockyard and West's property. Joshua Mauger's
Distillery was situated between the Dockyard and the present
hospital grounds. Guns were mounted on the careening wharf.
Three batteries with ditches and enclosures were formed by Col.
Spry, Chief Engineer, on the lower side of Brunswick Street; one
on the corner of Brunswick and North Streets, one on the south<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
corner of Dockyard Lane, and the other down Gerrish Street below
the Dutch burial ground. It was generally understood that these
works were on the opposite or western side of Brunswick Street,
but Desbarres' plan places them on the east side. The works on
Citadel Hill appear to consist of a small enclosure, but no regular
fortifications appear.</p>

<h3>EARLY PRINTING IN HALIFAX.</h3>

<p>In 1751 printing was first introduced into Nova Scotia. The
first press was established at Halifax, and there was not a second in
the province until 1766. Bartholomew Green, Jr., was the grandson
of Samuel Green, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was of
the firm of Green, Bushell &amp; Allen, of Boston. He removed to
Halifax with a press and type in August, 1751. He died about six
weeks after his arrival, 52 years of age.</p>

<p>John Bushell, who had been the partner of Green in Boston,
immediately succeeded him in Halifax. He printed for the government,
and in March, 1752,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> published the first newspaper printed
in Nova Scotia. The work for government was inconsiderable, but
was the chief support of Bushell. He was a good workman but
had not the art of acquiring property, nor did he make the most
economical use of the little which fell into his hands. Bushell
died in February, 1761. The proclamation published by Governor
Lawrence in 1758 for the settlement of the French lands on the
Basin of Minas was printed by John Bushell. Anthony Henry
succeeded Bushell as a printer at Halifax. He was a German, and
had lived some time with a printer, but had left his master and
became a fifer in one of the provincial regiments. With this
regiment he came to Nova Scotia, but some time after obtained his
discharge. There was then no printer in the province, and his
pretensions to skill in this art greatly facilitated his release from
the army. There appears, however, to have been a printing office
at Halifax in March, 1756, conducted by one Isaac Ourry. Henry
began business with the press and type which had been used by
Bushell. He published the Gazette. The government, through
necessity, gave him some work which was badly executed. This
paper was edited for some time by the Hon. Richard Bulkeley,
Secretary of the Province.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
In 1766 a printer with a new and good apparatus came from
London and opened another printing house. He published a newspaper
and was employed by government. Henry, who had been
inattentive to his affairs, did not despond at the prospects of a rival,
but, much to his credit, exerted himself and did better than before.
After a few years' trial, his rival, not finding the business so
profitable, nor place agreeable, sold out his paper, and Henry
was again the only printer in the province. He procured new type
and a workman better skilled than himself. His printing from this
time was executed in a more workmanlike manner. He remained
without another rival until the British army evacuated Boston, in
March, 1776, when the printers in that town who adhered to the
Royal cause were obliged to leave that place, and they, with other
refugees, came to Halifax. Henry continued printing until his
death. He possessed a fund of good nature, and was of a very
cheerful disposition. He died December, 1800, aged 66 years.</p>

<p>Robert Fletcher arrived at Halifax from London in 1760, with
new printing materials and a valuable collection of books and
stationery. He opened a book store and printing house near the
parade, published a newspaper and printed for the government.
Until this time there had been no book store in the province.
Fletcher executed his printing with neatness, and raised the reputation
of the art in Nova Scotia. He remained in Halifax until
1770, then sent his printing materials to Boston for sale and
went into other business.</p>

<p>Alexander and James Robertson, who had been printers in New
York, Norwich and Albany, went to Shelburne, in Nova Scotia, in
1783, where they printed a newspaper. John Howe began printing
in Halifax in 1776, and was publisher of the Gazette in 1801.
Howe commenced the Halifax Journal in 1780. In 1790 his office
was at the corner of Sackville and Barrington Streets. This paper
was afterwards purchased and carried on by John Munro; his office
was where Mr. Kenny's new stone building now is, at the corner of
George and Granville Streets. The weekly Chronicle was set on
foot by William Minns, a Loyalist settler, in 1786, and was
continued until 1828. Mr. Minns kept a stationer's shop in
Barrington Street, below the parade. This paper had the Star and
Garter at its heading.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
Henry's printing office was in Grafton Street, in rear of the
residence of the late Attorney General Richard John Uniacke,
where his descendants resided for many years. There was another
printing office in the same street, further north, which is represented
in the engraving of the town in 1776 with a steeple surmounted by
a hand holding a pen.</p>

<p>After the peace of 1784, printing found its way into the Province
of New Brunswick.</p>

of St. Aspinquid's Day, known as the Indian Saint. St. Aspinquid appeared in the
Nova Scotia almanacks from 1774 to 1786. The festival was celebrated on or immediately
after the last quarter of the moon in the month of May. The tide being low at
that time, many of the principal inhabitants of the town, on these occasions, assembled
on the shore of the North West Arm and partook of a dish of clam soup, the clams
being collected on the spot at low water. There is a tradition that during the
American troubles when agents of the revolted colonies were active to gain over the
good people of Halifax, in the year 1786, were celebrating St. Aspinquid, the wine
having been circulated freely, the Union Jack was suddenly hauled down and
replaced by the Stars and Stripes. This was soon reversed, but all those persons who
held public offices immediately left the grounds, and St. Aspinquid was never after
celebrated at Halifax.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>The following short sketch of some of the persons who took a
lead in establishing the Colony, has been compiled chiefly from
public records:</p>

<p>The Honorable Edward Cornwallis, the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief,
was a younger son of Charles, third Baron
Cornwallis by Lady Charlotte Butler, daughter of Richard, Earl of
Arran and uncle to the celebrated Duke of Ormonde. He was born
in 1713, was member of Parliament for the borough of Eye in 1749,
and was elected member for the city of Westminster in 1753, shortly
after he returned from Halifax. He married the same year, a
daughter of the late Lord Townshend, but left no children. He was
afterwards raised to the rank of Major General and appointed
Governor of Gibraltar. General Cornwallis was twin brother of
Dr. Frederick Cornwallis, Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p>The gentlemen who composed the first Council were Paul Mascarene,
Edward How, John Gorham, Benjamin Green, John
Salisbury and Hugh Davidson.</p>

<p>Col. Mascarene was a native of Castras in the south of France,
was born in the year 1684. His parents were Huguenots and were
compelled to fly from their native country on the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes when all Protestants were driven from France. He
made his way to Geneva at the age of 12, where he received his
education. He afterwards went to England, where he received a
commission in the British army in 1708. He was appointed Captain
in 1710 and ordered to America, where he joined the regiment raised
in New England for the taking of Port Royal. He was at the
capture of Annapolis Royal that year, and was for some time commander
of the garrison as senior major of the regiment. On the
death of Colonel Armstrong he became Lieutenant-Colonel of the
regiment under General Phillips, and was third on the list of councillors
in 1720, when the first Council was organized in Nova<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
Scotia. In 1740 he was appointed Lieut.-Governor of the fort, and
administrated the government of the Province until the arrival of
Cornwallis in 1749. He remained in command at Annapolis after
the settlement at Halifax, and was subsequently engaged as agent
of the British Government in arranging treaties with the Indians of
New England and Acadia in 1751. He retired from active duties
and died a Major General in the British army at Boston, on 20th
January 1760. He left a son and daughter. His son was said to
be living in New England in 1835, at a very advanced age. The late
Judge Foster Hutchinson, of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and
the late Deputy Commissary General William Handfield Snelling,
were his grandsons. His great-grandson, Mr. W. Snelling Stirling,
has his portrait, painted by Smybert of Boston about 1725.</p>

<p>Benjamin Green was a native of the province of Massachusetts,
born in 1713, youngest son of the Rev. Joseph Green, minister of
Salem, Mass., and graduate of Harvard College. He was brought
up as a merchant under his elder brother Joseph in Boston. In
1737 he married a daughter of the Honorable Joseph Pierce of Portsmouth.
He accompanied General Pepperal to Louisburg in 1745,
as Secretary to the expedition. After the capture of that place by
the Provincial army, he remained there as Government Secretary and
manager of the finances until Cape Breton was restored to the
French, when he removed with his family to Halifax, and was
appointed to the Council by Governor Cornwallis in July 1749.
After the removal of Mr. Davidson he acted as Secretary of the
province. He held several other important public offices, among
which were those of Treasurer and Judge of the Court of Vice-Admiralty.
On the death of Governor Wilmot in 1766, Mr. Green
being then senior councillor, was appointed Administrator of the
Government. He died at Halifax in 1772, in the 59th year of
his age. His eldest son Benjamin succeeded him as Treasurer of
the province. Benjamin Green, Junior, was father of Lieutenant
William Green of the Navy, and Joseph Green and Henry Green of
Lawrencetown, the latter left descendants at Lawrencetown. The
second son of Governor Green was many years sheriff of Halifax,
and having married a Boston lady, afterwards removed to that
place. His daughter was married to Mr. Stephen H. Binney, son
of Jonathan Binney of Halifax, whose descendants are numerous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
John Salisbury was brother to Dr. Thomas Salisbury, the eminent
civil lawyer in London. Lord Halifax was his friend and patron,
and sent him out with Governor Cornwallis as one of his suite. He
does not appear to have taken any active part in the settlement.
He married a Miss Cotton, who brought him a fortune of £10,000,
which he spent in extravagance and dissipation. He returned to
England in 1753, and died at Offley, the county seat of his relative
Sir Thomas Salisbury in 1762. His only daughter was the celebrated
Mrs. Thrale, the friend of Dr. Johnson, afterwards married
to a Mr. Piozzi.</p>

<p>Hugh Davidson also came out with Governor Cornwallis. He
was the first Provincial Secretary; he returned to England in 1750
under charges of trading in the supplies and stores for the settlers.
Governor Cornwallis in his letters to the Board of Trade, thought
him innocent of the main charges made against him.</p>

<p>Captain Edward How was a member of His Majesty's Council at
Annapolis in 1744. He was with Col. Noble at the affair at Minas
and Grand Pre in 1747, where he was severely wounded and taken
prisoner by the French under DeCorne. He came down from Annapolis
with Governor Mascarene in June 1749, and was sworn in a
member of Cornwallis' first Council. He was well acquainted with
the language of the Indians and their manners, and was sent on a
negotiation to the French and Indians at Beaubasin in 1751, where
he was treacherously murdered by the enemy, though acting under a
flag of truce, having been shot through the back from the bush.
The French officers denied having anything to do with this disgraceful
affair, and charged it on Mr. LeLutre, the Indian missionary,
who it was said was jealous of Mr. How's influence with the Micmacs.
His widow afterwards petitioned the government for
pecuniary aid, in consequence of her husband's services, and for
money advanced by him for public service. The late Richard W.
How, captain in the 81st regiment, formerly of Halifax, was his
grandson.</p>

<p>Colonel John Goreham was a native of Massachusetts; he was
with General Pepperal at the siege of Louisburg in 1745, as
Lieutenant-Colonel of his father's regiment raised in Massachusetts.
He afterwards had command of a company of Rangers at Annapolis
and came down to Chebucto with his rangers to meet Governor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
Cornwallis in 1749. He took precedence next to Governor
Mascarene at the council board. He is styled Captain Goreham by
Mascarene and by Cornwallis in his commissions and correspondence.
That of Lieutenant-Colonel was probably militia rank only. It is
probable he returned to Boston soon after the settlement was formed
as his name does not appear on the Council books after 1752. He
had a brother, Joseph Goreham, who was also a member of Council
in 1766; he afterwards attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in
the British army. He was engaged in the border skirmishes on the
isthmus from 1754 to about 1758, and was afterwards appointed
Commandant at Newfoundland.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonels Horseman, Ellison and Merser, who were
afterwards appointed to the Council, were the officers in command
of the regiments which came from Louisburg. They all retired soon
after to England.</p>

<p>Charles Lawrence was a Major in Warburton's Regiment of
Infantry. He came up with the army and was engaged during 1749
and '50 in the French wars at Cobequid. He acted as Brigadier
General under Amherst at Louisburg; he was a member of the
Council and sworn in Governor of the Province on the death of
Governor Hobson; the first assembly was convened during his
administration, (2nd October, 1758); he died unmarried on 11th
October, 1759, it is said of an inflammation, caused by overheating
himself at a ball at Government House; he was deeply respected by
the whole community, and the Legislative Assembly caused a monument
to be erected to his memory in St. Paul's church "from a
grateful sense of the many important services which the Province
had received from him during a continued course of zealous and
indefatigable endeavors for the public good, and a wise, upright, and
disinterested administration." This monument has now disappeared
from St. Paul's Church. His escutcheon remains in the East
Gallery. Lawrence, though an active and zealous governor, by his
desire to favor the officers of Government with a partiality for his
military friends, brought on himself an organized opposition from
the leading inhabitants of the town, who petitioned the Home
Government for redress of their grievances, which they in a great
measure attributed to the Governor and his Lieutenant Colonel
Monckton. His resistance to the desire to call a Legislative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
Assembly was among the chief charges against him. His death
shortly after the petition put an end to the difficulties. He was
succeeded by Judge Belcher as Administrator of the Government.</p>

<p>Charles Morris was a native of England; he was Captain of
Provincials under General Pepperal at the siege of Louisburg in
1745. He had been engaged by Governor Shirley of Boston in a
survey of the interior parts of Nova Scotia with a view to British
colonization, in 1745. He also commanded one of the Provincial
Companies sent to Minas under Colonel Noble in 1747. He was in
Halifax in 1749, and in company with Mr. Bruce the Military
Engineer laid out the town and peninsula. He was appointed to the
Council in 1755. Though Surveyor General of the Province he
acted for some time as Judge of the Supreme Court during the time
of Chief Justice Belcher, which offices were both afterwards filled by
his eldest son Charles. Captain Morris died in 1781, and was
succeeded in the office of Surveyor General by his son Charles,
whose son, the Hon. Charles Morris, also filled the same office and
was a Member of Council in 1808. He was the father of John
Spry Morris, Esq., afterwards Surveyor General, who was the fourth
in succession who had charge of the Surveying Department in Nova
Scotia. There are numerous descendants of Captain Morris in
Halifax.</p>

<p>Jonathan Belcher, the first Chief Justice, was a native of Massachusetts,
son of the Governor of that province, of an eminent
colonial family; he was appointed Chief Justice of Nova Scotia in
1754, when a young man, and administered the government on the
death of Governor Lawrence; Chief Justice Belcher arranged and
revised the laws as they appear on our first Statute Book, and
rendered good assistance to Governor Lawrence in founding the
settlements at Horton, Cornwallis, Falmouth, &amp;c., in 1758, '9, and
1760. Judge Belcher died poor; the Legislature voted a provision
to his only daughter. His son, the Honorable Andrew Belcher, was
for many years a resident in Halifax and member of Council.</p>

<p>Captain Wm. Cotterell was the first Provost Marshal or Sheriff,
(there being no county divisions at this time). He was succeeded
in that office in 1750 by Captain Foy, who held that situation many
years, and received a small pension on his retirement. Mr. Cotterel
afterwards acted as assistant Provincial Secretary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
William Nisbett came out with Cornwallis in 1749 as one of the
Governor's clerks. He practised as an attorney and solicitor. He
was appointed Attorney General on the resignation of Mr. Little,
which office he held for 25 years. He was one of the first representatives
in the General Assembly of 1758, and was elected speaker on
4th December 1759. He continued in the Chair of the House (with
the intermission of one session when sick) until 1783, when he
retired on a small pension and died the following year aged 83. In
1763 he declined a seat in the Council. During the period of his
being Speaker, the House sat for 11 years without being dissolved.
The old house in which Mr. Nisbett resided situated in Grafton
Street, Block letter E, Collins' division, mentioned in a former
chapter, still remains, though much changed by the cutting down of
the street many years ago. He left no male descendants. His
daughter, Mrs. Swann, died in the old Grafton street house about
60 years ago.</p>

<p>Archibald Hinshelwood was one of Governor Cornwallis' clerks,
and performed the duties of Deputy Secretary with Mr. Cotterell
and others for many years. Most of the drafts of the letters sent
to England by the first three Governors are in his handwriting. He
was elected a member of Assembly for Lunenburg in 1759 and again
in 1765. Lord William Campbell the Governor appointed him to
the Council in 1773, but he died before taking his seat. His
property on Argyle Street after occupied by the City Water office
fell to his nephew, (he having no children), who left two sons in the
navy, both of whom died young. The old property was sold about
60 years since and purchased by Mr. W. A. Black, who resided
there many years.</p>

<p>Otis Little was Captain of one of the New England Independent
Companies. He was probably a native of England. Being in
England in 1749, he came out with Governor Cornwallis, who
appointed him Commissary of Stores, from which office he was
dismissed on suspicion of having traded in the supplies for the
settlers. He acted as first Attorney General of the Colony, and
was probably a lawyer by profession. He was the author of a well-written
pamphlet on the resources of Nova Scotia, written in 1748,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
with a view to encouraging British emigration to the province.
Capt. Little left a daughter, who died unmarried at Halifax early in
the present century.</p>

<p>John Baptiste Moreau, designated gentleman and schoolmaster
in the book of the settlers, had been originally a Roman Catholic
priest, and Prior of the Abbey of St. Matthew at Breste. He joined
the expedition under Cornwallis in 1749, and went to Lunenburg
with the settlers in 1752. He received ordination as a clergyman
of the Church of England in 1750, and officiated to his countrymen
and the Germans in the County of Lunenburg, where he died much
esteemed and regretted in the year 1770. He left a son, Cornwallis
Moreau, who was the first male child born in Halifax, and was
called Cornwallis after the Governor. This old man was living at
La Have, in Lunenburg County, in the year 1848, being nearly 100
years of age. He received pecuniary assistance from the Nova
Scotia Philanthropic Society in that year.</p>

<p>Doctor John Breynton came up from Louisburg with the army,
where he had been acting Chaplain to the Forces. He succeeded
Mr. Tutty at St. Paul's in 1751 or 1752, in conjunction with Rev.
Thomas Wood. Mr. Breynton was inducted Rector in 1758 or '9,
under the provisions of the Statutes of the Province, and Mr. Wood
acted as Curate or Vicar. After Mr. Wood's removal to Annapolis
in 1763, Mr. Joshua Wingate Weeks, from New England, became
assistant minister at St. Paul's. Dr. Breynton received his degree
of D. D. in 1770. He died in 17&mdash;, and was succeeded at St.
Paul's, as rector, by the Rev. Doctor Robert Stanser, afterwards
Lord Bishop of the Diocese. Dr. Breynton was esteemed an
eloquent preacher, and was in the habit of addressing the settlers
in English, French and German.</p>

<p>John Creighton was an officer in the army. He served in the
Dragoons at the Battle of Fontenoy. Having been discharged at
the peace of Aix la Chappelle, he was placed on half pay as
Lieutenant of Warburton's Regiment of Infantry, and came out with
the expedition in 1749. Mr. Creighton was sent to Maligash with
Col. Lawrence in 1752 to assist in forming the settlement at
Lunenburg, where he continued to reside until his death, which
took place in 1807. He was Colonel of the Militia, Judge of the
Common Pleas, and for some time a member of His Majesty's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
Council, to which he was appointed in 1776. Col. Creighton was a
native of the South of England. He left numerous descendants in
this country. His youngest son, Col. Joseph Creighton, half pay
of 56th Regiment of foot, died at Halifax about 1854. His grandson,
the Hon. John Creighton, of Lunenburg, was a member of the
Legislative Council. Mr. James Creighton, the ancestor of the
family of that name now in Halifax, came out with Col. Creighton.
It does not appear there was any relationship between them. Mr.
James Creighton became one of the most thriving and influential
settlers in the town, and was the ancestor of one of our most
numerous and estimable families. Col. Creighton's daughters
married, one to the late Judge Wilkins and another to Hon.
Hibbert N. Binney, both of whom have left numerous descendants.</p>

<p>Perigrin Thomas Hopson, the second Governor at Halifax, was
Commander-in-Chief at Louisburg when that place was delivered up
to the French after the Treaty of Aix la Chappelle. He came up
with the army and was sworn in a member of Council in August,
1749. He succeeded to the government on the resignation of
Governor Cornwallis in August, 1753. He did not remain long at
Halifax. In 1757 he was gazetted a Major General, and in the
following year was appointed to the command of the forces destined
for the West Indies. He died before Guadaloupe a short time
before the Island was captured.</p>

<p>John Collier was a Captain in the army and Member of Council in
1752. He was appointed by Governor Cornwallis one of the
magistrates of the town, and had command of a section of the
militia; one of the divisions of the town being named after him.
He died at Halifax in 1769. It is uncertain whether he left any
descendants.</p>

<p>Richard Bulkeley accompanied Governor Cornwallis to Nova
Scotia as one of his A. D. C. in 1749. He was appointed Secretary
of the Province in or about 1759, which office he held until 1793
when, on his retirement, he was succeeded by his son, Michael
Freke Bulkeley, who died a few years after his appointment, 1796.
Capt. Bulkeley was called to His Majesty's Council in 1759, and as
Senior Councillor, he administered the government on the death of
Governor Parr, in 1791. He held, at various times, the offices of
Judge of Admiralty, Brigadier General of Militia, and Grand Master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
of the Masons. He died December 7th, 1800, at the age of 83,
beloved and respected by all classes throughout the province. He
was justly esteemed the father of the settlement, being the only
person of consideration then living who came in 1749. He had
been twice married. His first wife was a daughter of Capt. Rouse,
R. N.; she died in 1775. He had three sons, all of whom died
before him. His residence was at the corner of Prince and Argyle
Streets, opposite the south-west corner of St. Paul's Church. The
old stone house built by him still remains; it was for many years
the residence of the late Hon. H. H. Cogswell, and is now known
as the Carlton House. Mr. Bulkeley was buried under St. Paul's
Church. His escutcheon, with the bull's head crest, hangs in the
west gallery. The Hon. Richard Bulkeley was the only person who
ever held the rank of General of Militia in this country.</p>

<p>Capt. <a name="Horatio_Gates" id="Horatio_Gates">Horatio Gates</a> was A. D. C. to Governor Cornwallis with
Capt. Bulkeley. He had been in command of an independent
company of provincials in New York in the year 1737. After his
arrival in Halifax he was employed for a short time in the country
against the Indians and French. In 1762 he was appointed A. D.
C. to General Monckton, with the rank of Major, and accompanied
him in the expedition against Martinique. Gates was afterwards
better known as a General in the American Revolutionary Army.
Sir Robert Walpole, in a letter dated 1778, says Gates was the son of
a housekeeper of the Duke of Leeds. Sir Robert was his God-father.</p>

<p>Jonathan Binney was a native of Hull, a small village near
Boston. He came to Halifax shortly after the settlement was
formed, and was engaged in business. He was elected a Member
of Assembly for the town in 1761, and in 1764 was elevated to the
Council. In 1768 he was sent to the Island of St. John (now
Prince Edward Island) as Second Judge of the Local Court, and
afterwards held the offices of Collector of the Revenue at Canso and
Collector of Imports and Excise at St. John Island. He was
charged with errors in his accounts by Mr. Legge, the Governor of
the province, under which he went to England in 1776, where he
completely refuted the charges made against him. Mr. Binney
married Hannah, daughter of Mr. Henry Newton, a Member of
Council, and is the ancestor of the whole Binney family now in
Nova Scotia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
Joseph Fairbanks was from Massachusetts. He was one of the
representatives in the first House of Assembly, summoned in 1758.
Mr. Fairbanks left no children. His nephew, the late Rufus Fairbanks,
became heir to all his property in Halifax, which at the time
of his death was very considerable. Mr. Rufus Fairbanks was for
many years one of the magistrates of Halifax; he married a
daughter of Charles Prescott, sister to the Hon. Charles Prescott,
of the firm of Fairbanks &amp; McNab; of Hon. Charles R. Fairbanks,
many years a Member of Assembly for Halifax and Judge of
Admiralty and Master of the Rolls, and of Samuel P. Fairbanks,
formerly Member for Queens County, with other children.</p>

<p>Benjamin and Joseph Gerrish were both from New England.
The former was a member of His Majesty's Council, appointed in
1768, and Agent for Indian Affairs in 1760. The latter was many
years Naval Storekeeper at Halifax. He was also a Member of
Council. His appointment to the Board bears date August 16th,
1759, from which he was suspended in 1762 for non-attendance.
He died at Halifax in 1774. Mr. Joseph Gerrish built a residence
in the north suburbs, south of the Dockyard, between Lockman and
Water Streets, and had a fruit garden, the old stone wall of which
remained on the east side of Lockman Street until about 1835.
One of these gentlemen carried on business for some years in
company with Mr. Gray, who was connected with him by marriage.
Mr. Gray was father of the late Rev. Dr. Benjamin Gerrish Gray,
minister of St. George's, and afterwards Rector of Trinity, St.
John, New Brunswick, who was succeeded by his son, the Rev. Dr.
William Gray, lately deceased. He was also ancestor of Mr.
Charles Gray, British Consul at Virginia. The Hon. John Gray,
of St. John, New Brunswick, and Benjamin Gerrish Gray, Esq.,
barrister at law, of Halifax, are their descendants; one the son of
Mr. Charles Gray, the other of Dr. William Gray. A Mr. John
Gray came out with Governor Cornwallis in 1749 as a Deputy
Secretary; probably Mr. Gray who was in partnership with Gerrish
was the same person.</p>

<p>Major Leonard Lochman, (spelt wrongfully Lockman) was a
German doctor and practised his profession in early life. He came
out with the settlers in 1749 and resided in the north suburbs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
where he built a residence for himself and had a large garden.
This old house was lately pulled down. It stood on the upper side
of Lockman Street and was built with a hipped or gamble roof. He
received the rank of Major in the army for services performed to
the British Government. He died at Halifax, and was buried
under the little old Dutch Church, in Brunswick Street, where his
escutcheon and monument with armorial bearings are still to be
seen. The street between Brunswick Street and the water, which
was laid out between the German lots, was named Lockman Street
in compliment to the Major, who was for many years a leading man
in Dutchtown. It is not known whether he left any descendants in
the province.</p>

<p>The names of Jonathan Prescott, Malachi Salter, Richard Gibbons,
Lewis Piers and Otto William Schwartz appear among the principal
inhabitants of the town in 1750. Mr. Salter was from New
England, had been extensively engaged in the fishery, and had
visited Chebucto Harbor in 1744, five years before the settlement,
while on a fishing voyage along the coast. Chebucto was the
frequent resort of Cape Cod and Marblehead fishermen previous to
the settlement. He was a Member of Assembly and Justice of the
Peace for the town in 1759. The old house at the corner of Salter
and Hollis Streets, afterwards the residence of the Hon. W. Lawson,
and later of Mr. Esson, was built by Mr. Salter and was his place
of residence for many years. During the American revolt, Mr.
Salter, with several other gentlemen of the town, became suspected
of treasonable correspondence. He was twice under prosecution,
but on a full investigation nothing appeared to have been said or
written by him of sufficient moment to warrant the charges. Mr.
Salter was the ancestor of the family of that name now remaining
in Halifax. He died at Halifax, in January, 1781, aged 65.</p>

<p>Mr. Gibbons was acting Attorney General for several years, and
a leading practitioner at the Bar of Halifax. His son, Richard
Gibbons, died at Sydney, Cape Breton, at an advanced age, where
his descendants are numerous. The old gamble-roofed house at
the corner of Buckingham and Grafton Streets, known as Isles'
corner, lately pulled down, was the residence of Mr. Gibbons.</p>

<p>John Duport was the English Attorney. He came out with the
settlers in June, 1749, and in July following was appointed a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
Justice of the Peace. In 1752 he was made Judge of the Inferior
Court of Common Pleas. He performed the duties of Secretary of
Council for many years. He was sent as a Judge to St. John's
Island in 1770, and was afterwards Chief Justice of the Island.
Mr. Duport left a daughter married to Mr. P. Skey, of Falmouth,
and a son who was in the army and was father of Mr. Robert
Duport, later an officer in the Purveyor's department of the British
Army. Judge Duport was much esteemed, and appears to have
been an active public servant during the first twenty years of the
settlement.</p>

<p>Joshua Mauger was an English trader, who had been connected
with the government contracts at Louisburg, and appears to have
resided in Halifax for the purpose of commerce only. In 1751 he
held the office of Agent Victualler for the navy at Halifax. In
1754 he had shops established at Pisiquid (Windsor), Minas
(Horton), and other places, where he sold goods and spirits to the
French and Indians. He had still houses in Halifax where he made
rum which he supplied to the troops and the navy. Mr. Mauger
had some difficulties with Governor Cornwallis regarding illicit
dealing. He went back to England about 1761, and was appointed
Agent of the Province in London, which he resigned in the following
year, having secured a seat in the British Parliament. He owned
much property in and about Halifax. The beach at the entrance of
the harbor, extending westerly from Cornwallis, now McNab's
Island, was originally granted to Mr. Mauger, and still bears his
name.</p>

<p>Michael Franklin was a merchant from England who settled in
Halifax about 1752 or 1753. He was elected a Member of
Assembly in 1759, and appointed to His Majesty's Council in 1762.
In 1766 he received the appointment of Lieut.-Governor of the
Province, which he held until 1776, when he again took his seat at
the Council Board. Governor Franklin was a most active and
esteemed public officer. His name appears connected with almost
all the transactions of importance which occurred in the town from
1763 to 1780. During the American Revolt, his exertions in
support of British authority while administering the government,
were in a great measure instrumental in preserving the tranquility of
the province. He married a daughter of Mr. Boteneau, of Boston,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
whose wife was a daughter of Peter Faneuil of that city. He left
several children. The late James Boteneau Franklin, for many
years Clerk of the House of Assembly, was his eldest son. Mrs.
Fitzgerald Uniacke was his grand-daughter.</p>

<p>Lewis Piers was a grand-son of Sir Henry Piers, 1st Bart. of
Tristernagh Abbey, Ireland.</p>

<p>The Hon. Thomas Saul was the wealthiest and most enterprising
merchant from 1749 to 1760.</p>

<p>The names of Benjamin Gerrish, Charles King, Henry Ferguson,
Joseph Fairbanks, William Piggot, William Fury, James Grant,
Jacob Hurd, Daniel Shatford, Samuel Sellon, Charles Mason, Lewis
Piers and Robert Campbell appear on the lists of the Grand Jury
between 1751 and 1754.</p>

<p>The following names appear on the register of early settlers:&mdash;Richard
Wenman, Thomas Keys, John Edes, John Gosbee, Ralph
Coulston, Edward Orpen, John Christopher Laurilliard, Philip
Knaut, Peter Burgman, Otto William Schwartz, John Jacob Preper,
John Woodin, Andrew Wellner, Christopher Preper, Simon
Thoroughgood.</p>

<h4>Extract from a letter in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1749:</h4>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, 10th July, 1749.</p>

<p>We have advice that two French men-of-war of 80 guns, and 20
transports, with a Governor and troops for a garrison, have
arrived at Louisburg. The French Government offered Governor
Hobson to transport his garrison to Chebucto, which was accepted,
and orders came to discharge the vessels taken up here for that
service. Col. Cornwallis, Governor of Nova Scotia, arrived at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
Chebucto on 21st June<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> in the Sphinx, and Capt. Rouse in a sloop
of war, and fifteen transports with 2000 adventurers on board,
whose first settlement will be at or near Chebucto, where the
Governor intended to keep the transports till next year for the
convenience of the people, especially the women and children, until
houses are built. The same encouragement that has been given to
the British disbanded soldiers is given to Governor Sherley's and
Col. Pepperell's regiments. Rum was sold at Louisburg for 9d. per
gallon, and molasses extremely cheap. The French lost a great
number of men in their passage to Louisburg by the small pox,
yellow fever, etc., but the transports at Chebucto lost only one
child.</p>

<h3>E.</h3>

<p>The following extracts are from the letters of a French officer
after the siege of Louisburg:</p>

<p>"The eyes of all Europe are fixed on this formidable armament;
they have assembled an army of 22,000 men, 1600 brought from
Europe, the remainder provincial militia, with a large train of
artillery and munitions of war, 22 line of battle-ships and 200
transports. Yet Admiral Holburn, who appeared off Louisburg
with 22 sail of men-of-war, took it into his head that our numbers
were equal to his own, and has made his way back to Halifax. They
will ask him there, why did you run away? Oh! says he, a
superior force venit, vedit, fugit. It is vexatious that the first
squadron which France has equipped since 1703 should be shackled
with orders only to keep a look out. If ever there was a certainty
of firing gunpowder to the renown of the white flag, it was on the
19th August, when Holburn appeared off Louisburg."</p>

<p>In some of his subsequent letters he appears to give a very
accurate account of the siege, and some facts relative to the war
not to be found in any history of that period. In speaking of the
landing of Wolfe at the head of the Highlanders and the American
Light Troops&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the interest of the conquered not to diminish the glory of
the victor, and besides it is our duty to do justice even to our
mortal enemy, for which reason I confess that the English on this
occasion behaved with such valor as before the event must have
appeased temerity. Yet it must be allowed that at the same time
the difficulty of the enterprise does them infinite honor, it saves
ours; who would have forseen that they would have ventured to
have climbed rocks till then rendered inaccessible, under a heavy
fire from our batteries, notwithstanding their boats were every
moment knocked to pieces in the surf, which drowned great
numbers."</p>

<p>In speaking of the capitulation he says:</p>

<p>"Though reduced to the last extremity we demanded far more
advantageous terms than we had reason to expect. After a
consultation between Admiral Boscawen and General Amherst, an
unconditional surrender was demanded. Dracourt, the Governor,
extremely exasperated at those terms, resolved to hold out, but was
compelled to give in on receiving a most peremptory petition on the
part of the inhabitants, presented by M. Prevost. The capitulation
was signed on 15th July, 1758, after a bloody siege of two months.
On the day following, our troops were drawn up, and the colors
and arms surrendered to General Whitmore, who took command of
the town. The evening before the English took possession of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
town, we suffered our soldiers to plunder the magazines, and the
priests spent the whole night in marrying all the girls of the city to
the first who would have them. No one here can perceive, at least
by any personal inconvenience, that we are in a conquered town.
The garrison has embarked with as much tranquility as if it had
been going on a voyage of pleasure. Every soldier has taken away
whatever belongs to him without suffering the least injustice. M.
De Dracourt has received all the honors which a person of his rank
deserved; Admiral Boscawen has shown all the respect to Madam
De Dracourt as were due to her merits. This lady has performed
such exploits during the siege as must entitle her to rank among the
most illustrious of her sex, for she fired three cannon every day in
order to animate the gunners. After the surrender she interested
herself in behalf of all the unfortunates; in this number M. Maillet
de Grandville was a striking instance of the instability of fortune.
He left France at the age of 17, arrived at Quebec in indifferent
circumstances; by his industry and application to business, he
accumulated a vast fortune which enabled him to purchase the
Lordship of St. Louis, which cost him 80,000 livres; but now, by
the taking of Louisburg, he is left quite destitute with a numerous
family."</p>

<h4><i>From the Gentlemen's Magazine, Vol. 20, 271.</i></h4>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Halifax, Nova Scotia</span>, December 7, 1749.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have at various times given you the last account I
was able of the state of affairs in this Colony. The summer was
beautiful beyond description and even the conception of those who
are always confined within the liquid walls of Britain. As to the
winter, which you know I always dreaded, I do assure you I have
felt severer weather in England. The people acquainted with this
climate say that it began this year sooner than was ever known
in the memory of man, and assure me likewise that it will not be
more severe than it has been already; if so, there is no danger to
be apprehended from it. This you will readily grant when I tell
you, notwithstanding the tenderness of my constitution, to which
you are no stranger, that I have not added a single thing, not so
much as a great coat, to my dress since I have been in this
Province. When I look back upon the 21st June, the day of our
arrival, I am astonished to see the progress made; there are already
about 400 habitable houses within the fortifications and not less than
200 without. So surprising is the growth of this colony, so great the
happiness of being ruled by one who has no other interest at heart
but that of making thousands happy.</p>

<p>From my soul I wish that all other governors would copy such
an amiable example of imitation; he does not, like most others
gripe and squeeze to accumulate a fortune; on the contrary, he
derives no profit to himself from anything, but, with the most
unexampled generosity, gives all places and commissions gratis to
the most deserving, nor suffers his officers to take any fees at
present. You know what an English rabble is (and the greatest
part of this colony was such.) You know they are generally
tumultuous, refractory, full of discontent and murmuring, capricious
in demanding favors, not long satisfied with present concessions,
and not seldom abusing them by restless importunity for more.
Such generally is the rabble of mankind, and such were many of
the settlers of this province, but by his prudent management and
proper generosity, by his condescension, candor and affability, the
Governor has charmed the tiger's fury and turned a sad tumultuous
rabble into a tractable and quiet people. They now work with ten
times the alacrity they did at first, are patient under disappointments,
and when they meet with a repulse, they conclude their
petitions to have been unreasonable, from a firm persuasion that
His Excellency has their true interest at heart; they cannot ask
with reason, but what he grants with pleasure.</p>

<p>Resolved, That, Whereas a Light house at the Entrance of the
Harbor of Halifax, would be greatly beneficial to the Trade, Navigation,
and Fishery of this Colony, and might be the means of
preserving the Lives and properties of many of his Majesty's
Subjects, and whereas altho' many persons might willingly contribute
towards so good a Work without any Expectation of a
Reimbursement, yet probably many may more readily be concerned
therein, when attended with any hopes of promoting their own
Interest at the same time.</p>

<p>A Lottery, according to the following Scheme, be set on foot for
raising a sum of £450 towards building a Lighthouse at or near
Cape Sambrough, (whereby, besides the advantages before mentioned,)
a considerable number of Settlers will be usefully employed
for some time, and a great &amp; lasting Benefit to the province be
gained, by a voluntary Tax upon those persons (amongst others)
who at present contributed nothing towards the Expence of the
Government whose protection &amp; favour they enjoy.</p>

<p>(<span class="ucsmcap">COPY.</span>)</p>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Chebucto</span>, 22nd June, 1749.</p>

<p class="smcap">My Lord Duke,&mdash;</p>

<p>I arrived here yesterday,&mdash;this morning a Sloop arrived from Mr.
Hopson, which I am obliged to send to Boston in case any ship
should be going thence to England. I would not neglect an opportunity
of writing to your Grace. I met the "Fair Lady" storeship
at sea the eleventh, after we had been from England four weeks,
who told me the Transports arrived at Spithead the day before he
sailed, and were to sail in three days after him, we were then off
the island of Sable, and except the first eight days had met with
contrary winds all the passage, besides we had steered our course
for Cape Race but was forced off the banks by a gale of wind from
the North West so that I had reason to think the Transports might
be soon at Chebucto&mdash;we had nobody on board that knew anything
of the coasts nor of the Bay of Funday, so were to cruize off the
coasts till we met with a pilot, we made the Coast of Acadie the
14th, but met with no pilot till the 20th, when we met with a sloop
from Boston to Louisburgh with two pilots on board, for the use of
the Governor,&mdash;the wind not serving for the Bay of Funday, and the
officers assuring me in case of foggy weather (not unusual upon those
coasts) we might be a fortnight getting to Annapolis. The wind was
fair for Chebucto, so I thought it advisable to go in there rather
than risk the being some weeks, perhaps, after the settlers arrived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
I could save the garrison of Louisburgh the bad and long navigation
to Annapolis, so I sent to Governor Hopson that I was going for
Chebucto and desired him to transport the garrison thither, imagining
he had transports ready; by his sloop that came in this day I
find him in great perplexity, the French arrived, and he no transports.&mdash;The
Council of War it seems were of opinion that the
orders from the Secretary at War did not empower him to hire
transports, but to wait my arrival and that I was to send the
transports that brought the settlers here. As I cannot know when
the transports will arrive, in what condition, nor how many I can
spare, I think it absolutely necessary for the service to send the
sloop to Boston with orders to Apthorp and Hancock, who Mr.
Hopson has recommended as the persons who have been always
employed on the part of the Government, to hire vessels with all
expedition for the transportation of these troops from Louisburgh
to Chebucto. I send a letter by the same sloop to Colonel
Mascarene in case he should meet at sea any vessel going to
Annapolis. I likewise send a Frenchman that knows the country
over land, by Minas to Annapolis. I have ordered Colonel Mascarene
to come here with a quorum of the Council as soon as possible
that I may open my commission, take the oaths and appoint
another Council, according to His Majesty's instructions.</p>

<p>I can give Your Grace little information as yet as to this country&mdash;the
coasts are as rich as ever they have been represented. We
caught fish every day since we came within fifty leagues of the
coast, the harbor itself is full of fish of all kinds; all the officers
agree the harbor is the finest they have ever seen&mdash;the country is
one continual wood, no clear spot to be seen or heard of. I have
been ashore in several places&mdash;the underwood is only young trees
so that with difficulty one might walk through any of them;
D'Anville's fleet have only cut wood for present use, but cleared no
ground, they encamped their men upon the beach. I have seen but
few brooks nor have as yet found the navigable river that has been
talked of&mdash;there are a few French families on each side of the bay
about 3 leagues off; some have been on board. As to the
disposition of the French or Indians I can give Your Grace no
account till I see Colonel Mascarene, when I shall write more fully
and continue from time to time to acquaint Your Grace of our
proceedings. I wish the French may not be uneasy at waiting so
long on board for the evacuation of Louisburgh as it may be some
time before Mr. Hopson will get transports&mdash;it will, I fear, retard
the settlement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
(From the Duplicate.)</p>

<p>We came to anchor in Merliguiche Bay, where I was told there
was a French settlement. I sent ashore to see the houses and
manner of living of the inhabitants&mdash;there are but a few families
with tolerable wooden houses covered with bark, a good many cattle
and clear ground more than serves themselves&mdash;they seem to be
very peaceable, say they always looked upon themselves as English
subjects, have their grants from Colonel Mascarene, the Governor
of Annapolis, and showed an unfeigned joy to hear of the new
settlement. They assure us the Indians are quite peaceable and
not at all to be feared&mdash;there are none hereabouts.</p>

<p>(From the Duplicate.)</p>

<p>This Frenchman will be there in three or four days&mdash;'tis 25
leagues from hence to Minas, and the French have made a path for
driving their cattle over here.</p>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Chebucto</span>, <span class="smcap">July</span> 23rd, 1749.</p>

<p class="smcap">My Lord,&mdash;</p>

<p>My last to Your Grace was of June 22nd, a duplicate of which is
enclosed,&mdash;the 27th, the transports appeared off the harbor and in
a few days most of them got in. As their passage had been
extremely good and none of them had in the least suffered, I found
they would be ready to sail the moment the settlers should be put
ashore. I despatched a sloop to Boston to countermand the order
I had given, and sent to Mr. Hopson to let him know I would send
in a few days transports to bring away his garrison. Mr. Hopson
had wrote me that he had agreed with Desherbier, the French
Commissary, to make use of the French transports upon condition
that in case the English ships should arrive before they were all on
board he should be at liberty to disembark them. I sent him one
the 1st of July and four more, the largest of the fleet, the 5th. I
own I was much disappointed in finding Mr. Hopson unprovided
with transports as I never had the least intimation that he was to
wait for the ships that should bring the settlers. I have an account
from Boston of July 3rd that my second order got there soon
enough to prevent all but one from sailing, but as they were all
hired this will cause some expense; they write me it will not be
much.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
July 8, I received from Mr. Hopson copies of letters from
Governor Shirley and Colonel Mascarene giving an account of the
French having begun a settlement and a fort at the mouth of the
St. John River. As my instructions direct me to prevent all such
encroachments, and particularly mention that River as of the
greatest consequence, I next day sent Capt. Rous of the Albany
with a small sloop to attend him with orders to the commanding
officers at Annapolis to furnish him with troops if demanded.
Copies of my letter to Capt. Rous and one to the commander of
St. John's, I send You Grace enclosed. I hope what I have done
in this affair will meet with Your Grace's approbation. July 12th
I heard from Governor Shirley, that he had sent the Boston to
Annapolis to receive my instructions about the affair of St. John's.
I sent Capt. Pearse the same directions I had given to Capt. Rous,
and a copy of the declaration asserting His Majesty's rights. As
to Port Mouton which is mentioned in these letters, I believe it was
a mistake occasioned by the French having put in there in their
way to St. John's.</p>

<p>I shall now lay before Your Grace our proceedings at Chebucto.</p>

<p>Colonel Mascarene arrived here on the 12th with five of the
Council; next day I opened to them His Majesty's commission, and
took the oaths; the day following I nominated the members of a
new Council:</p>

</table>

<p>I have added since, Mr. Steel.</p>

<p>As, perhaps, no copies were taken of the plans sent me of the
harbor, I send along with this a copy of Durel's plan. Your Grace
will see that the place I have fixed for the town is on the west side
of the harbor&mdash;'tis upon the side of a hill which commands the
whole peninsula and shelters the town from the north-west winds.
From the shore to the top of the hill is about half a mile, the ascent
very gentle, the soil is good, there is convenient landing for boats
all along the beach and good anchorage within gunshot of the shore
for the largest ships. In Durel's plan the two points that make
the entrance to Bedford Bay are marked as the places proper to
fortify, which is likewise taken notice of by Mr. Knowles. Their
view must then have been to have the settlement within that bay.
This would have been subject to great inconveniences. In the first
place, it would be too far up for the fishermen, it being about five
leagues from the entrance of the harbor to these points, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
beach all along as proper for curing their fish as can possibly be
imagined, so that no fisherman would ever have thought of going
within these forts&mdash;indeed no ships would choose to go so far, as no
finer harbor can be than that of Chebucto, which reaches from these
points to Sandwich River,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> so that notwithstanding of any forts
upon these points an enemy's fleet might lie secure and indeed block
up all ships within the bay. The proper places to fortify for the
defence of the harbor seem to be Sandwich Point and the bank
opposite to it. George's Island lies likewise very convenient for a
battery to defend both the harbor and the town. It contains about
ten or twelve acres. It was there I landed the settlers from on
board the ships sent to Louisbourg&mdash;I have now a guard there and
stores, and propose to build a magazine upon it for powder.</p>

<p>As there was not one yard of clear ground, Your Grace will
imagine our difficulty and what work we have to do. However,
they have already cleared above 12 acres and I hope to begin my
own house in two days; I have a small frame and planks ready.</p>

<p>The Indians are hitherto very peaceable, many of them have been
here with some Chiefs; I made them small presents, told them I
had instructions from His Majesty to offer them friendship and all
protection and likewise presents which I should deliver as soon as
they should assemble their tribes and return with powers to enter
into treaty and exchange their French commissions for others in
His Majesty's name.</p>

<p>Three of the French Deputies have been here to know what is to
be their condition for the future; I gave them copies of His
Majesty's Declaration and copies of the Oath of Allegiance which I
told them they must take without any condition or reservation, but
in the same manner as His Majesty's English subjects;&mdash;they
pretend their only difficulty is from fear of the Indians in case of a
French war. I have ordered all the Deputies to come here and
expect them in a few days. I think 'tis necessary to show them
that 'tis in our power to master them or to protect them, and therefore
I design to send as soon as possible two companies to Minas
with orders to build a barrack and stay there the winter. I shall
also send an armed sloop into the Bay of Minas to prevent all
correspondence with the French by sea; another company I shall
send to the head of the bay where the road to Minas begins. I
propose, likewise, a blockhouse half way for the conveniency of
travellers, and then to employ all the men I can get together,
soldiers and inhabitants, to clear the road from hence to Minas; 'tis
about 30 miles in a direct line&mdash;whether this can be executed before
winter I cannot say. Had the garrison of Louisbourg been arrived,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
they would have been of infinite advantage; at present I have only
one company of Hopson's, one of Warburton's and 60 of Gorham's
Rangers.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

we shall have made.</p>

<h4><i>From the Gentlemen's Magazine, Vol. 20, 1750. (June.)</i></h4>

<p>The Town of Halifax is entirely built according to the plan given
in our last February number, and many additional buildings are
carrying on. The barracks for the soldiers are completed and the
fort at the mouth of the harbor will soon be in a good posture of
defence.</p>

<p>The story in the papers of the Indians burning a town of 200
houses is without foundation.</p>

<p>Major Lawrence, of Warburton's Regiment at Nova Scotia,
appointed Lieut.-Col. of Governor Cornwallis' Regiment and Lieut.
Governor of Annapolis Royal. (July number of the Magazine,
1750.)</p>

<p>August, 1750. Halifax, Nova Scotia.&mdash;The fishery here is
extremely good, one company only having 1400 or 1500 quintals of
good dry fish ready to ship for a foreign market, and others also
have been very successful. Mr. Brown, gardener to Governor
Cornwallis, with his son and four others, going out two or three
miles from the town, were beset by the Indians, who killed him and
his son; the latter they buried, but the other body was found on the
ground scalped, and brought hither and buried; the four others, it
is feared, are killed or carried off. The Indians have also attacked
and scalped seven men that were at work on the other side of the
harbor. Parties are gone out to repel them.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
